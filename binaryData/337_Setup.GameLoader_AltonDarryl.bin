action:response:root-2-A
Alton
root-2-A-3:I guess that depends on if you believe in God or not.
</>root-null:Well, have fun with that.
action end

action:statement:root-2-A-3
Darryl:No, no.  I mean this ship.  Why is it here, and what are these people doing on it?
next:root-hiddenside
action end

action:response:root-hiddenside
Alton
root-hiddenside-A:Well, because they bought a ticket, I guess?
root-hiddenside-B:In that case, why are you here?
</>root-hiddenside-null:I should probably go.
action end

action:statement:root-hiddenside-A
Darryl:That's how they got here - not why.
Darryl:We're not sailing to the Caribbean, or anywhere that people actually pay money to go.
Darryl:We're in the middle of nowhere on a ship that sits just a bit too low in the water for my liking.
Darryl:There's no way this ship pays for itself.

Darryl:I'm here because I want to be around as few people as possible.
Darryl:So, I'm traveling somewhere I assume no one else would want to go.

</>root-null:Talk to you later.

Darryl:Maybe.  I don't know you.
