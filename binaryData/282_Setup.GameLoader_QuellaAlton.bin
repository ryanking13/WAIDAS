Quella
root-1-B:I'm sure it'll pick up around here.
root-1-C:I think everyone's a little caught up with their own stuff.
</>root-null:Well, good luck with that.
action end

action:statement:root-1-B
Alton:Yeah, yeah...you're right.
Alton:Maybe.
next:root-null
action end

action:statement:root-1-C
Alton:I know.  Everyone's busy.
Alton:But I mean, everyone needs to relax at some point, right?  Why not here?
Alton:Sometimes it feels like I'm being avoided.

action:statement:root-2
Alton:I don't know...I just...
Alton:I'm such an idiot.  I should have seen this coming.

Alton:That obvious, huh?
next:root-2-A
action end

action:statement:root-2-B
Alton:I really liked her.  I just wanted to help her out, you know...
Alton:And she just used me!  That's the only reason she ever kept me around in the first place!
next:root-used
action end

action:response:root-used
Quella
root-used-A:Oh, I'm sorry.  That must be a terrible feeling.
root-used-B:There's no way you could've known.
root-used-C:It happens, sometimes.
action end

action:statement:root-used-A
Alton:Thanks...honestly, the worst part is just how clueless I was.
Alton:I bet she was laughing at how stupid I was the whole time...
next:root-used
action end

action:statement:root-used-C
Alton:Well for me, it always happens.
next:root-used
action end

action:statement:root-used-B
Alton:Yeah there was.
Alton:This always happens.  I don't know what I was thinking.
Alton:Why else would she have spent time with me?  Nobody actually likes being around me.
next:root-used-2
action end

action:response:root-used-2
Quella
root-used-2-A:That's not true.:trigger.chap2AltonReassure.on
root-used-2-trigger.chap2AltonReassure:I'm talking to you right now, aren't I?
root-used-2-B:You're taking this really personally.  Isn't she the one that did something wrong?:trigger.chap2AltonReassure2.on
root-used-2-trigger.chap2AltonReassure2:I don't think she sees you that way.  Have you tried talking to her?:trigger.chap2altonDenial.on
action end

action:statement:root-used-2-A
Alton:You're just being nice.  I spend all day, every day, up here by myself.
Alton:When I talk to people, they just want the conversation to be over.  I can tell.
Alton:I thought maybe this time would be different.  Stupid, stupid, stupid...
next:root-used-2
action end

action:statement:root-used-2-trigger.chap2AltonReassure
Alton:Yeah, but that's just because you feel bad for me right now.
Alton:It's not like you're here because you enjoy my company or anything.
next:root-used-2-A
action end

action:statement:root-used-2-B
Alton:Well...well, yeah.  I guess.
Alton:But it's really my fault.  I should've known.
Alton:I'm just this stupid guy that'll do what she asks and can be tricked...
next:root-used-2
action end

action:statement:root-used-2-trigger.chap2AltonReassure2
Alton:Well...no.
Alton:I guess I could try...what's the worst that could happen?

root-1:How's the observation room?
<!>chap2Alton:You seem...even worse off than before.  What's wrong?
</>root-null:Never mind.

action:statement:chap2Alton
Alton:I had a talk with Xu.
Alton:It turns out she hates my guts and always has.

Quella
chap2Alton2-A:I'm sure you're exaggerating.
chap2Alton2-B:Maybe the two of you just aren't a good fit.  It happens.
action end

action:statement:chap2Alton2-A
Alton:No, I think she was pretty clear.
Alton:In her eyes I'm a rich suburban kid, and she resents me for that.
next:chap2Alton2
action end

action:statement:chap2Alton2-B
Alton:Maybe you're right.
Alton:She was always so nice to me.  Just really sweet and friendly.  But that was a complete front.
Alton:We were never on an equal level.  She sees me as more privileged than her, or whatever.
Alton:I should've never taken this job.

action end


action:statement:chap2Alton2-E
Alton:I thought on this ship, I could travel.  Meet lots of people.  It'd be great.
Alton:But instead everyone sees me like some kind of useless parasite.
Alton:I have the easiest job here, and I'm an abject failure at it, and nobody likes me.
Alton:This whole thing was a mistake.  I should be back home.  I was stupid to leave.

chap3-B:You said you came here to travel?
</>chap3-null:Never mind.

action:statement:chap3-A
Alton:I'm okay.
Alton:It's fine.  I mean, it was all my fault anyway.  I should've known better.
next:chap3
action end

action:statement:chap3-B
Alton:Yeah.  I mean, I'm not here for the excellent resume building opportunity.
Alton:I just wanted to get out, see a bit more of the world.
Alton:It's not as romantic as it sounds.
next:chap3-travel

action:response:chap3-travel
Quella
chap3-travel-A:It sounds like you want to get a more stable job.
chap3-travel-B:So you took a gap year after college to travel, I take it?
</>chap3-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:chap3-travel-A
Alton:Maybe.  If I just got a desk job, I'd probably meet other kinds of people.
Alton:A lot of the people here are...different.
Alton:Maybe I'd fit in better in a place like that.
next:chap3-travel
action end

action:statement:chap3-travel-B
Alton:A gap year?  Um...y-yeah.  That's what I did.
Alton:Because I graduated last year.  From college.
