Quella:It may sound that way, but it's actually a happy story.
Quella:It's about endings.  I mean, everything ends, and often before we're ready.
Quella:But endings are necessary.  They teach us to enjoy what we have while it's here.
Quella:And even when we find ourselves in what seems like a living nightmare, we can still find comfort.
Quella:I guess it's not a happy story.  It's...bittersweet?
