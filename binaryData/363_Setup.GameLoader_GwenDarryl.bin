Darryl:I was just kidding.  It's not the greatest city ever - it's just a city.
Darryl:All cities are just cities.  People make more out of them than they are.
Darryl:It's not about where you are...it's about who you're with.

Gwen
chap5-A:Thanks for your help back there.
chap5-B:The killer is still around.  And they tried to frame me.
</>chap5-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:chap5-A
Darryl:Sarcasm.  I get it.
Darryl:I may not have been very supportive, but I didn't think you were guilty.
Darryl:But without evidence...
next:chap5-A-1

action:response:chap5-A-1
Gwen
chap5-A-2:If enough of you spoke up, it might've helped.
chap5-A-3:You didn't even try.
</>chap5-null:Forget it.
action end

action:statement:chap5-A-2
Darryl:Maybe.
Darryl:Some people were pretty invested in the story of your guilt.
Darryl:I wonder what would have happened if it came down to a protest.
next:chap5-A-1
action end

action:statement:chap5-A-3
Darryl:...You're probably right about that.
Darryl:I'm sorry, Gwen.
next:chap5-A-1
action end


action:statement:chap5-B
Darryl:...It's strange, though, isn't it?
Darryl:Up to this point, there has been no concrete evidence left behind of the captain's or Donovan's dissapearances.
Darryl:That would take great diligence and forethought.
Darryl:But the evidence used to frame you was...very incomplete.
next:chap5-B-1
action end

action:response:chap5-B-1
Gwen
chap5-B-2:What are you trying to say?
</>chap5-null:Talk to you later.
action end

action:statement:chap5-B-2
Darryl:Think about it.  The murderer would have access to something much more incriminating.
Darryl:But someone deliberately chose the key - a deeply flawed piece of evidence.
Darryl:It's as if they didn't care - or they even expected this to happen.
Darryl:...I don't completely understand it.  But I don't like it.
