root-A:Are you insane?  You think we'll just stand around and let you do this?!
root-B:Aren't you curious how we got down here?  How we got a master key?
</>root-null:Never mind.

Donovan:Does it tell me who the killer is?

Xu
root-B-2:Having a master key is the only way someone could get down here.  Whoever had one must be the killer.
root-B-3:It was anonymously given to us, for the purpose of framing Gwen.
action end

action:statement:root-B-2
Donovan:Of course.  But I never found a second copy of a master key.  So, where did it come from?
next:root-B-1
action end

action:statement:root-B-3
Donovan:So you don't know where it came from or who originally possessed it.
next:root-B-4
action end

action:response:root-B-4
Xu
root-B-5:No, but the person that gave the key has been bribing staff for a long time.
<!>root-B-confession:One of my tasks was to take the original master key and keep it in my room.:trigger.chap5XuConfession.on
root-B-6:Why would they give away their only way to enter this room?
</>root-B-7:No, I don't.
action end

action:statement:root-B-5
Donovan:Well, that...sort of helps.
Donovan:So the killer had a long established arrangement with this ship.  But for what purpose?
next:root-B-4
action end

action:statement:root-B-confession
Donovan:Well, I hope you were paid well.
Donovan:Because that decision to steal the key started a long chain of events that ended in me being shot and Paulo irreversibly crippled.
Donovan:You are a massive idiot.
Donovan:Who else helped our killer?  You should probably speak up now.
next:root-B-4
action end

action:statement:root-B-6
Donovan:Good point.  Hmm...what are the chances of there being a third key?
Donovan:It's possible, given how clean this area of the ship is of clues, that they expected it to be exposed in the near future.
Donovan:They may have been trying to wash their hands of it and cut their losses.
Donovan:And it would have completely worked in that case.
next:root-B-4
action end

action:statement:root-B-7
Donovan:Shame.
Donovan:But it's a piece of the puzzle.
Donovan:What other information have you all been holding out on me?
