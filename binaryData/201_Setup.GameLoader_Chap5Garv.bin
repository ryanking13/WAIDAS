root-A:This is ridiculous.  You need to slow down and re-evaluate things.
root-B:There must be some evidence we can use.  Some details.  Something!
</>root-null:Never mind.

Garv
root-A-2:You still can't explain the captain's disappearance, or these other people.  Killing everyone won't answer anything!
root-A-3:If we can come up with a theory that explains everything, maybe the killer will become obvious.

action:statement:root-A-2
Donovan:I don't need to answer anything.  I don't care anymore.
Donovan:Maybe you want to know why these things have happened.  I think it's too late for that.
next:root
action end

action:statement:root-A-3
Donovan:I need something better than a theory.  I need proof.  And as far as I can tell, there is none.
Donovan:Maybe it went overboard with the captain.  Maybe it was here before I was thrown overboard.  But it's gone now.

root-B-4:Do these other people have anything on them?  Clues of where they're from?
</>root-null:Never mind...

action:statement:root-B-2
Donovan:There's some basic, non-spoilable food and drink.
Donovan:But they're mostly empty, and I'd expect to find other things here.
Donovan:For example, these people are all heavily sedated, but there's no drugs remaining here.
Donovan:I think someone dumped everything important out of them.  It's a dead end.

Donovan:There was a crumpled piece of paper in his pocket.  It came from a book.
Donovan:I couldn't see anything about it that was relevant to this whatsoever.

action:statement:root-B-4
Donovan:Tattered rags for clothes and small cots, nothing else.
Donovan:No identification.  No possessions.  The only thing I can say is they're not from around here.
