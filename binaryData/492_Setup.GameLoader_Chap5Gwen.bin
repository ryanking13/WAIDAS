root-A-2:It's hard to explain.  I thought you were following me.  I was...paranoid.
root-trigger.chap6FerdEnd3:Ferdinand told me you were suspicious.  I told him what I saw in your room.

Donovan:I expect the person who ambushed me knew I had the master key.  That's how they anticipated me.
Donovan:At that time, Sue knew because I got the key from her.  And you knew because you broke into my room.
Donovan:But neither of you fit the profile.
Donovan:But Ferdinand...he fits the profile.  And he knew.
Donovan:Why did you tell him?
Gwen:He made me scared.  I think he knew that if he did, I might do something rash...
Ferdinand:T-that's not what happened!  I merely confided in her that the captain was missing.
Ferdinand:I personally disapproved of her actions!  I never told her to do anything!
Donovan:Even so, you set her against me.  And you knew I had the master key.
Donovan:You were the only suspect with that information.
Ferdinand:Well, perhaps, but what if she told someone else?  Or what if...what if I told someone else?
