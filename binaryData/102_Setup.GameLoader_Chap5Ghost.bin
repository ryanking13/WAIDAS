<!>root-trigger.chap6GarvEnd1:Marcurio was feeding the people down here with kitchen stock.
<!>root-trigger.chap6GarvClue3:The camera footage on your computer shows something important.:trigger.chap6GarvEnd3.on

Donovan:That makes this easy.  And yet...

Donovan:I have to admit...I was wrong.
Donovan:I thought she would be down here, but instead I found that kid.
Donovan:The same thing that happened to me must've happened to her.  She found out too much, got too close to the truth - and was silenced.
Donovan:But her discovery, and her death, led us to this exact moment.  I'm not going to waste that.

action:statement:root-B
Donovan:There's no way you could know that.
Donovan:But I'm not doing this to avenge her.  This goes far beyond that.

Donovan:I'm not sure I want to know.
Donovan:The strange thing is they've clearly been here for our whole trip, but are relatively uninjured.
Donovan:Yet that kid has been here for just a day, and has been tortured.
Donovan:After all of this, I feel like I still haven't come close to the truth...
Donovan:But then, I don't have to.  I already have a way to solve everything.

Donovan:That would answer the question of how these people have stayed down here for so long.
Donovan:How do you know he was doing this?

<player>
root-corruption1:There were notes in the cupboard talking about dropping off supplies.  He was being bribed.
root-corruption2:The kitchen ledger showed mysteriously missing stock.  
<!>root-corruption3:The captain had found out.
action end

action:statement:root-corruption1
Donovan:Bribed?  By who?
Xu:We don't know.  All the payments and instructions were anonymous.
Donovan:And in all this time you never pieced together who it was?
Marcurio:It's been different people over time.  It was all extremely organized...zero loose ends.
Donovan:Not zero.  I'm still here.
next:root-corruption
action end

action:statement:root-corruption2
Donovan:I get it.  Marcurio, you've been the inside-man for this whole operation, haven't you?
Donovan:It would seem impossible to sneak all these people in and manage them in total secrecy.
Donovan:But if you have someone who knows the ins and outs of the ship, where everyone is...
Marcurio:Hey, I never knew about this place, or what was going on!  I just delivered things.
Donovan:No.  You did more than that.  You helped cover this up.
Donovan:Even if you didn't know about this place, you still worked to conceal details that would lead to it being found.
Marcurio:It was all very organized.  It's not like I had a chance to observe anything.
Donovan:I wonder about that.
next:root-corruption
action end

action:statement:root-corruption3
Donovan:So the captain was on to what you were doing.  And then soon after, she was gone.
Donovan:Even if you are as ignorant as you say, you undeniably had motive to silence her.
Marcurio:No way.  You're not really thinking that I...?
Donovan:Come to think of it, all of this is just evidence that you were responsible for this operation.
Donovan:There's almost no evidence anyone else was involved.
Marcurio:That's ridiculous!  Look, there's no way it could've been me!
Donovan:Then who was it?
Marcurio:...One of the passengers.  I know that much.
Donovan:So you were holding out earlier.  You better talk, and fast.
Marcurio:When the captain arrived, things changed.  The way I received messages, what they told me to do...
Marcurio:The person that was giving me orders changed, and it gave me some hints who they were.

root-desperation-captain:What do you mean, when the captain arrived?
<!>root-desperation-way:How did the way you received orders change?:trigger.chap6bothClue1.on
<!>root-desperation-orders:What new orders did you have?:trigger.chap6garvBridgeClue.on
</>root:That's enough.
action end

action:statement:root-desperation-captain
Marcurio:I have a theory.
Marcurio:Smilla, our deceased captain, was brand new.  This was her first voyage.
Marcurio:The captain before her...I'm pretty sure he was on the take.
Marcurio:Something must have happened to him though.  He was replaced at the last second with Smilla.
Marcurio:I think there was some change in management, if you could call it that.
next:root-desperation
action end

action:statement:root-desperation-way
Marcurio:The notes I received were usually slid under my door while I was on shift.
Marcurio:That way I could never see who it was.  It was discrete enough.
Marcurio:Recently, though, the orders have been placed in the broom closet.
Marcurio:It's strange, because it's an unnecessary risk - what if someone else found those notes?
next:root-desperation
action end

action:statement:root-desperation-orders
Marcurio:Before the ship departed, before everyone had even boarded, I was instructed to leave the boarding ramp out overnight.
Marcurio:This would've allowed anyone to get on and off board without anyone knowing.
Marcurio:And they could smuggle anything...or anyone...on board.
Marcurio:Here's the thing.  At that time, all staff was already on board.  So the only reason I'd need to leave the ramp out...
Donovan:...Is if the smuggler wasn't staff.  They were a passenger.
Marcurio:Exactly.

action:statement:root-trigger.chap6GarvClue3
Donovan:How did you find that?  My computer was password protected.
Donovan:Well...what are you talking about?  I never caught anything incriminating.
Donovan:I wasn't able to hide cameras on the first floor, which was the most important thing.

root-garvClue2-A:Marcurio said that he was getting orders from the broom closet.  Who was seen regularly going in there?
action end

action:statement:root-garvClue2-A
Donovan:...Hold on.
Donovan:Marcurio said before this boat trip, he got orders slid under his door.  Why did that change?  Why now? 
Donovan:I wonder if the smuggler realized I had bugged the ship.
Donovan:If they were seen sliding notes under the door of staff, it would alert me.  I would investigate.
Donovan:So they disguised their correspondence with something innocuous.
Donovan:Something like...cleaning up after their cat.
Donovan:Marcurio was going in and out of the closet per his usual need to clean the kitchen...but so were you, Garv.
Garv:...Hm.  As it happens, I was.
Donovan:Anything to add on that?
Garv:Not really.  I have a litter box I need to regularly clean out.
Donovan:You were the only person besides Marcurio who was going in and out of there.  You were orchestrating this!
Garv:That's a lot of conclusions to draw from such a small detail.
Donovan:Well, how do you explain how those notes got there?
Garv:I'd say that Marcurio's making this up to cover how suspicious he is.  Maybe if he can tie a detail to someone else, he'll be okay.
Garv:You have to admit there's nothing concrete tying me to anything he's talking about.
Donovan:...That doesn't mean there isn't anything.  It just means I haven't found it yet.  But I will.
Garv:No you won't - not if I'm innocent.
