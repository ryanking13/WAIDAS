Garv
root-1:You happy here?  How are wages?
root-2:What kind of things does an employee key open around here?
</>root-null:Goodbye.

action:statement:root-1
Xu:Criminal.  Wages are criminal.  Let's just leave it at that.
Xu:On a related note, thanks for the tips.  Anything helps.
next:root-1-A
action end

action:response:root-1-A
Garv
root-1-B:How much do you think the others make?
root-1-C:Do you have any alternate form of revenue?
</>root-null:Goodbye.
action end

action:statement:root-1-B
Xu:I can only guess.  Marcurio probably makes about as much as me.
Xu:Alton, for whatever reason, makes actual money.  Maybe because they think he's got other options.
Xu:It's not fair, but there you go.
next:root-3
action end

action:response:root-3
Garv
root-3-A:Have you ever wondered what the captain makes?  Or...made?
root-3-B:It seems like you're bitter over it.
</>root-null:Goodbye.
action end

action:statement:root-3-A
Xu:Are you trying to imply something?
Xu:Of course I've wondered how much she made.  Obviously it had to be more than the rest of us.
Xu:Same goes for that strange first mate.
Xu:But I'm sure it's all still modest money.  Nothing I'd do anything dumb over.
next:root-3
action end

action:statement:root-3-B
Xu:Well, yeah.  You would be too.
Xu:I don't even know what Alton or Ferdinand are doing most of the time.  I don't think anyone else knows either.
Xu:Any idiot can tell things are screwed up here.
next:root-3
action end

action:statement:root-1-C
Xu:Alternate forms?  I'm not sure what you mean...
Xu:There's tips, I guess.
Xu:Other than that, can't say I have any other source of...income.
next:root-null
action end

action:statement:root-2
Xu:That's a strange question to say the least.
Xu:Regular employees don't have much extra access to the ship.
Xu:Only the captain and first mate are given access to all utility rooms and compartments.
Xu:We're given keys that correspond to our responsibilities on the ship, and nothing else.
next:root-2-A
action end

action:response:root-2-A
Garv
root-2-B:You wouldn't have access to the cabinets in the pilothouse, though, would you?
root-2-C:What does that mean for the other employees?
</>root-null:Goodbye.
action end

action:statement:root-2-B
Xu:Well...sure.  That's where returned keys are placed, so we all need access to them.
Xu:Otherwise how could we hand back keys to the ship?
next:root-2-A
action end

action:statement:root-2-C
Xu:You are really interested in this, aren't you?  Well, whatever.
Xu:Marcurio gets access to the kitchen supplies and food, Alton gets access to the electronics and so on...
Xu:Ferdinand has access to pretty much all utility closets and whatever doesn't belong to the passengers.
Xu:I get nothing special, because I'm just the waitress.
Xu:Satisfied?
