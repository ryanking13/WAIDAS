root-trigger.chap3SecretArea:Do you know about any secret areas on the ship?
</>root2-null:Never mind.

action:statement:root2-1
Alton:I...I don't believe she's dead.  She can't be.  Marcurio's just too cynical.
Alton:I'm sure she's here.  Maybe she's just trapped in her room or something?
next:root2
action end

action:statement:root2-2
Alton:We should look for her!  How can we do anything without making sure she isn't here?
Alton:Her room has been locked these past few days, but I don't know how we could open it.
Alton:Thing is, she was the one with the ship master key.  I think there was a spare, though.

action:statement:root2-3
Alton:There's no way anyone on this ship would want to murder the captain.  That's just crazy talk.

action:statement:root2-4
Alton:The captain?  She doesn't get along with everyone, but I like her.  She's just trying to do her best.
Alton:I mean, sure, she can be kind of...abrasive.  But I think it's just because she's so new.
Alton:She's just trying to give a strong first impression.

root2-captain-C:Just how long has she been captain?
</>root2-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root2-captain-A
Alton:Oh.  Uh...I don't think I was supposed to say that.
Alton:I mean, it's not that bad, really.  Just, you know, some minor disagreements is all.
Alton:Her and Marcurio haven't seen eye to eye on everything.
next:root2-captain
action end

action:statement:root2-captain-B
Alton:Well, she's really friendly most of the time.  She's just strict sometimes.
Alton:When she found out how much electricity I use in the observation room, she said she was going to take a hammer and smash all of my speakers.
Alton:But hey, she didn't!
next:root2-captain
action end

action:statement:root2-captain-C
Alton:This is actually her first voyage on the ship.  So, everyone's still getting used to her.
Alton:She's worked on other boats in the past, though.  So she knows her way around things.
next:root2-captain
action end

action:statement:root-trigger.chap3SecretArea
Alton:They say there's a couple somewhere around here.  Left over from the days this ship smuggled stuff.
Alton:If I'm being totally honest, I've tried looking for them on my own.  A way to pass the time, I guess.
Alton:I didn't find anything though, so I don't know.
Alton:Here's the thing, though - if there were secret compartments, how could they go all this time without being discovered again?

root3-A:What do you think happened to Donovan and Paulo?
root3-B:Do you believe that Gwen is guilty?
root3-C:Why do you think all of this has happened?
root3-D:What should we do now?
root3-E:What can you tell me about the captain?
</>root-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root3-A
Alton:I guess I have to face the truth.  The captain is...gone.
Alton:Donovan and Paulo, well...they probably are too.
Alton:I just don't understand.  How?  Was there anything we could have done?
next:root3
action end

action:statement:root3-B
Alton:I mean...I guess I have to, right?  After what we found.
Alton:Everyone seems pretty sure it was her.  I don't know.  I guess I wouldn't believe it no matter who it was.

root3-B2:What if the key was planted in her room?
root3-B3:Why do you think she did it?
</>root-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root3-B2
Alton:P-planted?  You mean, someone put the key in her room on purpose to incriminate her?
Alton:I guess that is possible, yeah.  It wouldn't be hard since the key would be able to unlock the door to her room.
Alton:In fact, I don't know why I didn't think of that sooner.
next:root3-B1
action end

action:statement:root3-B3
Alton:I have no idea.  I'm confused enough about this whole situation; that kind of thing is way beyond me.

action:statement:root3-C
Alton:You are asking the wrong person.  I am completely at a loss.
Alton:I'm sorry.
next:root3
action end

action:statement:root3-D
Alton:I don't know.  The others are saying we should just keep the situation calm until we land.
Alton:I guess that seems like the most reasonable thing to do.
next:root3
action end


action:statement:root3-E
Alton:It's still hard for me to believe she's gone.  But...with everything that's happened...
Alton:I liked her.  She didn't get along with everyone, but...she was just trying to do her best.
Alton:She could be kind of...abrasive, but I think it's just because she was so new.

Alton:When she found out how much electricity I use in the observation room, she said she was going to take a hammer and smash all of my speakers.
Alton:She sounded serious, but ultimately she didn't, so I guess it worked out!
Alton:But I mean...she was usually pretty nice.

Alton:She had barely been here at all.  Why would anyone want to harm her?
