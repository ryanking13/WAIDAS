Xu
root-1:You really like animals, huh?
root-trigger.ChapterTwoOn:Have you run into Donovan?
root-3:What's your trade?:trigger.chap1xuGarvProgress.on
</>root-null:Never mind.

action:statement:root-1
Garv:Of course I do!  Who doesn't like animals?
Garv:They're so innocent.  Incorruptible, even.

Garv:You mean the man in the room next to me?  No, I haven't.  Why?
next:root-2-A
action end

action:response:root-2-A
Xu
root-2-B:Oh, I just want to talk to him.
action end

action:statement:root-2-B
Garv:He's rather reclusive, so I haven't seen him much.
Garv:He seems to have a mean streak.  When my cat rubbed up against him, he looked as if he wanted to kick her!
Garv:A man with no warmth for pets...quite the brute.

action:statement:root-3
Garv:Ah, now there's a girl with a head on her shoulders - asking the one question that matters!
Garv:I'm a wholesaler - basically, I buy product where it's cheap, move it to a place where it's expensive, and sell it.
Garv:It's not a terribly complicated business, but it is quite lucrative.
next:root-null

Xu
root2-A:Why'd you decide to bring your pets on board, anyway?
root2-B:Earlier you said you're a wholesaler.  What kind of product do you move?:trigger.chap3xuGarvProgress.on
</>root-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root2-A
Garv:Oh, you know.
Garv:Allowing them to get outside and experience new environments is healthy for them.
Garv:Wouldn't want them to get cabin fever!
next:root2
action end

action:statement:root2-B
Garv:Ah, yes, that's a good memory.
Garv:I move...well, it's a bit of an exotic product.  It's a bit problematic to explain.
Garv:It suffices to say that transporting it is quite the challenge.
Garv:It requires a very resourceful kind of person.
