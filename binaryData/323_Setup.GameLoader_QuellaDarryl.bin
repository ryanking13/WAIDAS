Quella
root-1:You look worried.  What's up?
root-2:You spend a lot of time out here, don't you?
</>root-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root-1
Darryl:Worried?  No, just...lost in thought is all.
next:root-thoughts
action end

action:response:root-thoughts
Quella
root-thoughts-A:Penny for your thoughts?:trigger.chap2quellaDarrylProgression3.on
root-thoughts-B:You're not really a fan of small talk, huh?
root-trigger.chap2quellaDarrylProgression3:The one that got away, something like that?
</>root-null:Talk to you later.
action end

action:statement:root-thoughts-A
Darryl:Oh, just thinking about someone I used to know.
next:root-thoughts
action end

action:statement:root-thoughts-B
Darryl:Ha, sorry.  I guess I'm just not in a talkative mood right now.
Darryl:I appreciate the effort, though.
next:root-thoughts
action end

action:statement:root-trigger.chap2quellaDarrylProgression3
Darryl:Well...not exactly.  But close enough.
next:root-thoughts
action end

action:statement:root-2
Darryl:I guess I do.
Darryl:There's just something very calming about looking at the ocean.
next:root-ocean
action end

action:response:root-ocean
Quella
root-ocean-A:It is very pretty, isn't it?:trigger.chap2quellaDarrylProgression.on
root-trigger.chap2quellaDarrylProgression:Insignificant?  That's more scary than calming...
root-ocean-B:You do seem exceptionally calm.:trigger.trigger.chap2quellaDarrylProgression2.on
root-trigger.chap2quellaDarrylProgression2:What was your job, and why'd you leave?
</>root-null:Talk to you later.
action end

action:statement:root-ocean-A
Darryl:It's sublime.
Darryl:When you look at the ocean, or the stars, you're reminded of just how insignificant you are.
next:root-ocean
action end

action:statement:root-trigger.chap2quellaDarrylProgression
Darryl:Maybe both.  You know, when I was a kid I had a huge fear of the ocean.
Darryl:Knowing I could just sink further and further down, never reaching bottom...
Darryl:Up here the ocean is a nice blue color, but go down just a bit and it becomes pitch black.
Darryl:It terrified me.  Why shouldn't it?  But it's something you just learn to...ignore.
next:root-ocean
action end

action:statement:root-ocean-B
Darryl:Well, I don't have a lot to worry about anymore.
Darryl:I left my job, and now I'm just living the good old hobo lifestyle.
next:root-ocean
action end

action:statement:root-trigger.chap2quellaDarrylProgression2
Darryl:Oh, I was an attorney.  A smart, boring occupation.
Darryl:I left because...well, I just need to take a break from everything right now.
Darryl:You could call it an early retirement.
next:root-ocean
action end



action:response:root2
Quella
<!>root2-trigger.chap3readMarisJournal:I'm sorry, but I read your journal.
root2-A:What was that about back there?
root2-B:Something about the captain's disappearance has upset you.
root2-C:Have you noticed anything suspicious around the ship?
</>root2-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root2-A
Darryl:The captain...a murder...I don't have the energy to deal with it.
Darryl:And even if I did, there's still nothing I could do about any of it.
Darryl:I couldn't help her, and I can't help anyone here.
next:root2
action end

action:statement:root2-B
Darryl:She reminded me of...someone I used to know.
Darryl:It doesn't matter anymore.
next:root2
action end

action:statement:root2-C
Darryl:I did notice some things were missing from my room.  Like the key to my journal.
Darryl:And when I say missing, I mean stolen.  Seems like there's a thief on board.
Darryl:Not sure why they took the key.  They might have thought it opened something more important.
next:root2
action end

action:statement:root2-trigger.chap3readMarisJournal
Darryl:You...what?  That was private.  Extremely private.
Darryl:There's a reason it was locked.  And how did you get the key?
next:root3
action end

action:response:root3
Quella
root3-1:I got the key from Sue's room.  I think she stole it from you.
action end

action:statement:root3-1
Darryl:Is that right?  Well...thanks for letting me know, I guess.
Darryl:But there was no reason to use it for yourself.
next:root3point5
action end

action:response:root3point5
Quella
root3-2:I'll return the key, but we have to talk.:trigger.chap3DarrylSpills.on
action end


action:statement:root3-2
Darryl:There's nothing to talk about.
Darryl:You read the journal, so you know what happened.
Darryl:We were married for three years.  Moved out to the suburbs, got a house...had plans for a family.
Darryl:She was stressed about her work, but she was happy.  I thought.
Darryl:She had combined medications.  Lots of them.  I guess she wanted to be sure.
Darryl:I came home from work late and, well...there she was.
next:root3-3
action end

action:response:root3-3
Quella
root3-A:I'm so sorry.
root3-B:She was on medication?
root3-C:It wasn't your fault.
action end

action:statement:root3-A
Darryl:Sure.
next:root3-3
action end

action:statement:root3-B
Darryl:For her anxiety.  She would have panic attacks some times.
Darryl:She also took sleeping pills.  Sometimes she got so tense about things, she had a hard time sleeping.
Darryl:They told me it was slow, but peaceful.  Six to ten hours between the overdose and death.
Darryl:I worked late that day.  I could have been there.
next:root3-3
action end

action:statement:root3-C
Darryl:There were signs.  For a long time, really.
Darryl:But I never saw them.  And she never brought it up.
Darryl:Why?  Why didn't I notice?  For years she was suffering, and I did nothing.
Darryl:Nothing.
next:root3-4
action end

action:response:root3-4
Quella
root3-why:She hid it well.  You couldn't have known.
root3-support:Have you talked about this with others?
root3-counsel:Have you gone to counseling?
root3-escape:Darryl, you look like death itself...where are you really traveling to?:trigger.darrylUnlocked.on
action end

action:statement:root3-why
Darryl:...Maybe.
Darryl:But if I did...if I knew.  She'd still be here, wouldn't she?
next:root3-4
action end

action:statement:root3-support
Darryl:Yes.  With her family, and mine.
Darryl:No one saw it coming.
next:root3-4
action end

action:statement:root3-counsel
Darryl:...A couple times.  But I stopped going.
Darryl:I wasn't getting much out of it.
next:root3-4
action end

action:statement:root3-escape
Darryl:Far away, I hope.  I can't be sure.
Darryl:But it doesn't matter.  None of it matters.
next:root3-death
action end

action:response:root3-death
Quella
<!!>root3-death-A:God never gives you more than you can handle.:trigger.epilogueQD1.on
<!!>root3-death-B:Darryl...what are you planning on doing?:trigger.epilogueQD2.on
<!!>root3-death-C:If you ever want to talk, I'm here to listen.:trigger.epilogueQD3.on
action end

action:statement:root3-death-A
Darryl:...What a load of cliche bullshit.
next:root-null
action end

action:statement:root3-death-B
Darryl:...
Darryl:We're just strangers.  There's no reason for you to care about me.
Darryl:So please...don't.
next:root-null
action end

action:statement:root3-death-C
Darryl:I don't think that'll be necessary.
Darryl:But...thank you.

root4-B:Something about the captain's disappearance upset you.
root4-C:You should go back to therapy, Darryl.  You aren't okay.
root4-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root4-B
Darryl:She reminded me of Mari.
Darryl:A lot of things remind me of her.
Darryl:...Everything does.
