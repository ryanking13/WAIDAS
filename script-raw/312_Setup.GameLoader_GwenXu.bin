action:statement:chap4-C-2
Xu:Especially me.
Xu:Can I let you in on a secret, Gwen?
Xu:People are stupid.  You flaunt the truth in their face and they'll still take the lie you slip under their door.
Xu:People don't want the truth.  So I don't give it to them.

action:statement:chap4-E
Xu:Oh yeah?  And who would that be?  One of the other passengers, who isn't known to skulk around the ship all the time?
Xu:Someone who isn't constantly paranoid and obsessed with other people on the ship being their enemies?
Xu:You dug this hole, Gwen.  You dig yourself out of it.

action end

action:statement:chap5-trigger.chap4gwenXuProgress
Xu:...No.  You're right.
Xu:I knew the key in your room wasn't the same as the one Donovan had.

action:response:chap5-key
Gwen
chap5-key-A:So why didn't you say something?
<!>chap5-key-B:Why did Donovan have the master key, again?:trigger.end2Donovan.on
<!>chap5-key-trigger.end2Donovan:...And to think I was suspicious of him.
</>chap5-null:Forget it.

action:statement:chap5-key-A
Xu:I'm sorry...I was scared of what would happen.

action:statement:chap5-key-B
Xu:Well...it's sort of a long story.
Xu:He said he was here on a search for a serial killer, if you can believe that.

Gwen
<!>chap5-key-ferd2:Yeah.  Ferdinand was especially worried about him, actually...::trigger.ending2GwenFerdinand.on
action end

action:statement:chap5-key-ferd2
Xu:Is that right?  I don't recall him saying anything like that to me.
Xu:If anything, he's always had the same oblivious, optimistic outlook on everyone.
Xu:...Strange.

action end


action:statement:chap5-A
Xu:Well, someone has been handing out bribes to staff.
Xu:Er, by staff I mean...Marcurio and I.
Xu:I don't know if it's gone any farther than the two of us.

Xu:I don't know.  It was all very anonymous.
Xu:Notes left in random, discrete places...I never figured who it was.

action end

action:statement:chap5-A-3
Xu:For my part, uh...I guess you could say I held onto things.
Xu:Recently, I was told to take the captain's master key from the pilothouse.
Xu:I knew it was the captain's, not mine, but...it was just lying there.  It seemed innocent enough.
Xu:...That was not long after the captain had disappeared.
