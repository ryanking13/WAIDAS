Garv:Wait...what?  What's going on?
Donovan:You were just telling us how you murdered the captain.
Garv:What?  I'd never say something like that - I mean, I never...
Donovan:Getting cold feet?  We all heard you.
Garv:I don't understand...
Donovan:It makes sense, given the camera footage I have of you, and Marcurio's testimony.
Donovan:The evidence points to you secretly bribing the staff.  They were helping you keep this place a secret.
Donovan:The captain must have begun to figure out what was happening.  So she had to be killed.
Donovan:And then when I got too close to finding this place, I had to be silenced too.

Garv:If you were right and I killed the captain, why is Paulo down here, alive?

Donovan:I'm starting to understand all of that more and more.
Donovan:The correspondence with staff...the way this ship was run...it all points to one thing.
Donovan:This is a cargo ship for humans.
Donovan:On the upper decks, the ship ferries passengers from place to place, as a cruise ship.
Donovan:But it's all a facade.  The real passengers are here, on the bottom deck.  They're why we're all here.
Donovan:Loaded and unloaded in secret.  Drugged, beaten and broken down, so they can be shipped off and sold.
Donovan:I've seen this before.  Sex trafficking.  But I've never seen it this organized.

Marcurio:Honestly?  I was starting to have my suspicions that it was you.
Garv:What?  No, don't listen to him - he's a madman, holding us all here hostage!

Garv:I can see what we all really are.  People are just animals!  Vile, desirous creatures!

Donovan:...Hold on.
Donovan:The details behind Paulo's abduction make it clear that one of the staff had to be behind it.
Donovan:But the details of Marcurio's orders make it clear that he was colluding with one of the passengers.
Donovan:This is an obvious contradiction, and there's only one explanation for it.
Donovan:I'm actually after two people.  Two people with different motivations and methods.
Donovan:Was I given bad information?  If I was...it means I can't know anything for sure.
Donovan:And if I can't find out who both of them are, that leaves only one option for me.

action:statement:root7
Donovan:I've heard enough.
Donovan:I think I finally understand.
Donovan:The person who led me here in the first place, who took Paulo...
Donovan:The person who ambushed me and the captain, who bribed the staff...
Donovan:They were two separate people.  They traded information, collaborated...that's how they were always a step ahead.
Donovan:Who does the evidence point towards regarding Paulo?  Ferdinand.
Donovan:Who does the evidence point towards regarding the staff?  Garv.
Donovan:But the evidence doesn't cancel itself out.  It was both of you, wasn't it?
next:root-null
action end

action:statement:root8
Garv:This theory is a bad detour.  You said yourself you were after one person.  You had a profile.
Garv:What are the odds that this killer you were looking for would run into someone they could collaborate with?
Donovan:It sounds unlikely, doesn't it?
Donovan:But I got my info from someone had been tracking my killer.  Maybe the killer expected they'd be tailed.
Donovan:...Is it possible my target sought out another person that they could hide behind?
Donovan:When Gwen told Ferdinand about what she found in my room, he realized I was following him.
Donovan:Then he told Garv, who was able to get the jump on me.
Donovan:With me out of the picture, Ferdinand thought it was safe to target Paulo.  At the same time, Garv worked to frame Gwen.
Garv:I can understand why you'd suspect me.  But what you don't know is I helped prove Gwen's innocence!
Garv:I also helped uncover evidence from Paulo's room!  Why would I do all of that?
Donovan:Maybe because it was your plan to get us all here in the first place.
Donovan:My murder was one death too many.  It was too much attention.  You knew you had to cut your losses.
Donovan:So you cleaned this place of any evidence tying you to it and found someone who could take the fall.
Donovan:But Gwen wasn't the scapegoat - it was Ferdinand, wasn't it?
Donovan:The evidence in Paulo's room incriminates him, not you.  And the evidence here does the same.
Donovan:You counted on everyone uncovering the pieces of truth you left behind, and accepting the story I had given them of a serial killer.
Donovan:Am I right?

Garv:What the fuck are you talking about?!  I had nothing to do with any of that!
Ferdinand:Sure you did.  You told me that Donovan had been taken care of, and that you'd incriminate Gwen with your copy of the master key.
Ferdinand:Ha!  I bet you knew the whole time that they would figure out it was a plant.  You sneaky old bastard!
Garv:S-shut up...this man is crazy!  I don't know what he's talking about!
Donovan:You know exactly what he's talking about.
Ferdinand:You were gonna sell me out from the start, after how much I had helped you!  How rude.
Garv:Fuck you, you lunatic!  You ruined everything!
Garv:You brought feds onto my ship, and you tipped off the captain...that was black-mail, not help!
Ferdinand:Well, okay, but I also helped you get rid of the captain, and the fed, so isn't that like a wash?
