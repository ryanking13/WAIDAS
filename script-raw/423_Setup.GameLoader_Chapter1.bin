Alton:Hey, Marcurio!  Glad I found you.
Marcurio:You are?  What's going on?
Alton:Oh.  Uh, nothing.  Nothing really.  You finished up at the diner?
Marcurio:Pretty much, dinner hours are over.  I'm gonna go back up and clean the kitchen, though.
Alton:You really like staying in the kitchen after hours, huh?  I don't think I've ever actually seen you turn in.
Alton:My shift in the observation room is over, so I'm gonna kick back and relax!
Marcurio:...Was there something you needed?
Alton:Oh, that's right, I just remembered.  I was looking for Sue.  She's probably off hours too, right?
Marcurio:Yeah, of course.
Alton:Any idea where she went?
Marcurio:No.
Alton:Oh, okay.  I just thought...she looked kind of upset earlier today, didn't she?
Marcurio:Maybe.  I wouldn't know.
Alton:I was just curious what was up.
Marcurio:Probably nothing.
Alton:Oh.  Well, maybe I'll stop by her room to check on her, just in case.
Marcurio:Knock yourself out.  I'm going to clean the kitchen now.
Alton:....Bye....

Xu:Really?  The captain, Smilla?
Xu:I guess we never got to talk to her, but she is still a suspect.
Xu:But, as the captain, she has a key that can open any lock.
Xu:I don't think she'd need to break into my room if she really wanted...
Xu:Why do you think it was her?

action:statement:root-failFerdinand
Xu:Ferdinand?  If the first mate was breaking into rooms that would be really bad.
Xu:He is new here - this is his first voyage with the ship.  So I don't know much about him.
Xu:Why do you think it was him?
next:root-fail

Xu:Marcurio?  No, no way - I don't think so.

Xu:Oh jeez, you're still reacting to the dust, huh?  I really need to clean up my room, I guess.

Xu:Ha, I just had a thought.  Maybe the person left their finger print in the dust on my glass furniture!
Xu:Now, all we need is a copy of the finger prints from everybody on the ship...

action:statement:root-fail5
Alton:Alright, lemme check and see if there's anything like that.
Xu:Wait, Alton!  You don't have to do that.  I was just joking!  
Xu:I mean, there's no way we could figure out who it was from a finger print.
Alton:But...there are no finger prints.
Xu:What do you mean?
Alton:I mean there are finger marks where someone touched the glass...but there are no finger prints.
Xu:Oh, okay.  Hmm.
Alton:So...I guess they were wearing gloves, then?
Xu:I guess.
next:root-null

action:statement:root-fail6
Xu:Wait...that's it!  Alton, you're a genius!
Xu:If there are no prints, it means they must have been wearing gloves, which means it must have been...

Alton:There's an MP3 player here - a really good model!  I used to have one like that, but I lost it.
Xu:...Um...
Alton:And those headphones are a really good brand too.  Not cheap.  I had one like that too, but I...
Alton:...Lost it.
Xu:...
Alton:I never lost them.  You stole them.
Xu:Alton, wait, it's not like that.
Alton:I was always just an easy mark, huh?  A walking pile of money.  That was how you saw me.
