root-trigger.ChapterTwoOn:Have you seen the captain around recently?
root-1-B:The weather's looking bad.  Will we be alright?
root-trigger.ChapterThreeOn:Are you sure something hasn't happened to the captain?

action:statement:root-trigger.ChapterTwoOn
Ferdinand:No, I suppose that I haven't.
Ferdinand:I'm sure she was just gone for a moment.  Perhaps using the lady's room!
Ferdinand:Never fret, our diligent captain is surely at the helm this very moment!
next:root-1-A-2
action end

action:statement:root-1-B
Ferdinand:Alright?  Of course we will be alright!
Ferdinand:There may be a storm on the horizon, but it is no match for the SS Douce Amere!
Ferdinand:With our fearless captain and myself at her side, what can a little wind and rain do to us?
Ferdinand:I suspect we'll hit land without delay.

Ferdinand:Like I said, there is no cause for alarm.
Ferdinand:She's most likely somewhere around here.
Ferdinand:Though it would be irresponsible of her to leave the helm for so long!

Xu
root-missing-A:But where would she be?  I've already looked almost everywhere.
root-missing-B:Is there anything you're not telling me?
</>root-null:Forget it.
action end

action:statement:root-missing-A
Ferdinand:Hmm...I wouldn't be too sure of that.
Ferdinand:I'm sure there's still a couple of places she could be hiding.
next:root-missing
action end

action:statement:root-missing-B
Ferdinand:Nope!  Can't think of anything!  Nothing at all.
Ferdinand:If there were something I wasn't telling you, why, I'd tell you.
