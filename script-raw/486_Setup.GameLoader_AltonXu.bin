action:statement:root-why-6
Xu:Well, not everyone has it off as well as you do, Alton.
Xu:You're here because you wanted to take a long vacation.  But others are here because it's the only way they'll stay fed.
Xu:If I didn't have this job, I'd be completely screwed.  Same with Marc.
Xu:And they know that, so they charge us shit for honest work.
Xu:Meanwhile, you get to sit around all day doing nothing, and for way higher pay.
Xu:What if I told you that there's a whole world of people living under you?
Xu:That you are so privileged over, you aren't even aware of them?

<!!>root-6-A:Do you expect me to fall for any of those excuses?:trigger.epilogueAX1.on

action:statement:root-6-A
Xu:What?  I'm telling you the truth.  It's not an excuse.
Xu:Like I thought, you don't care.  It's uncomfortable to think about so you just ignore it.
Xu:You're really like all of the others, aren't you?
next:root-null
action end

action:statement:root-6-B
Xu:You're probably right.  I'm not going to try and justify my actions.
Xu:But you're lying to yourself if you think you understand.
Xu:It's easy to have a strong sense of right and wrong when they've never been tested.
next:root-null
action end

action:statement:root-6-C
Xu:Well...they are.  I'm stuck here, you know?
Xu:You can leave here, get a real job, move on with your life.  But not me.
Xu:I'm going to spend the rest of my life in this awful place.  I know it.
Xu:Look...I'm sorry about what I did.
Xu:I just want you to know it wasn't personal.

root3-A-3:I thought it was an old vase?
</>root3-null:Forget it.

Xu:Yeah, I don't know.  Why would he go to such lengths to steal that?
Xu:I really wish I understood why.  But I don't think he'll just tell me.

action:statement:root3-A-3
Xu:Huh...?  Did I say that?
