Marcurio:Well...since you asked, I guess I'll just be honest with you.
Marcurio:Don't get me wrong, I like her, but she's kinda abrasive.
Marcurio:I mean, it's her job to act really nice to the passengers.  That's what a waitress does, right?
Marcurio:Doesn't mean that's who she really is.  She doesn't wear the apron all the time, you know?

Marcurio:No.  I spent some time organizing, too.
Marcurio:Look, I have an inventory to manage and keep stock of.
Marcurio:If I get sloppy and disorganized, stuff gets forgotten.  Things go bad.  Money is lost.
