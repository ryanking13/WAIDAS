Paulo:As expected, something as simple as a cat would be easy to take control of.
Paulo:Well?  How do you like your new body?
Paulo:Admittedly, it will be hard to do much if you can't even speak English...
Paulo:But you will need it to leave this room.

Paulo:Like I said, your connection to this world is weak.
Paulo:In fact, it's so weak that you may have a hard time moving through solid objects.  Like doors.
Paulo:You will need to explore areas within a host body before you have the ability to enter them as yourself.
Paulo:...In other words, you'll need to leave this room as that cat.
Paulo:I could open the door for you, but I think it's important you get the hang of doing things on your own.
Paulo:Oh, and in the future, feel free to come back and talk with me.  I'll try to give advice on what to do, if I can.
Paulo:...It's not like I have anyone else to talk to.
