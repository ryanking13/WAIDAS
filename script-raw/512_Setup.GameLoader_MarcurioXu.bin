root-1:Things aren't so great between you and Alton now, huh?
root-2:So, what's your plan to get off this piece of scrap again?
root-3:How'd you get stuck on this ship anyway?
</>root-null:Bye.

Marcurio
root-1-B:You bring him down easy?
root-1-C:Nothing else to say?
</>root-null:Guess you don't want to talk about it.
action end

action:statement:root-1-B
Xu:I guess not.  Things kind of...
Xu:Well, there's nothing I can do about it now.
next:root-1-A
action end

action:statement:root-1-C
Xu:Sorry.  Don't really want to get into all that right now.
next:root-1-A
action end

action:statement:root-2
Xu:I guess I'm figuring it out as I go.
Xu:Saving up money for a ticket out of here would be...tricky.  And getting another job is near impossible.
Xu:I might have to strike some kind of deal if I can.

action:response:root-2-A
Marcurio
root-2-B:I don't like the sound of that.
root-2-C:What kind of deal?
</>root-null:Well, good luck.
action end

action:statement:root-2-B
Xu:Well, that's not saying a lot coming from you.  No offense.
Xu:Look, I can handle myself, alright?  I always look before I leap.
next:root-2-A

action:statement:root-2-C
Xu:I don't know.  Bribery?  I'd do blackmail if I could find a hook.
Xu:I'm not there yet.  But I think I'm getting close.

action:response:root-2-D
Marcurio
root-2-E:Blackmail?  You must have a death wish.  It would never work.
action end

action:statement:root-2-E
Xu:Maybe you're right.  Maybe not.
Xu:But if it was the only shot I had left, I'd probably take it.
next:root-null
action end

action:statement:root-3
Xu:You've never asked me about that before.  Why now?
next:root-3-A
action end

action:response:root-3-A
Marcurio
root-3-B:Because I want to know now.
root-3-C:I'd kinda like to know who I'm working with here.
<!>root-trigger.chap3MarcPressesXu:Considering all the shit you do that I turn a blind eye to, I think you kinda owe me this.:trigger.chap3XuUnlocked.on
</>root-null:Forget it.
action end

action:statement:root-3-B
Xu:That's your reason?  Really? 
Xu:Sorry, if that's all it is, then I'd rather not get into my history.
next:root-3-A
action end

action:statement:root-3-C
Xu:I could say the same to you.  But I keep my questions about why you're here to myself.
Xu:We trust each other, right?  Those things aren't important.
next:root-3-A
action end

action:statement:root-trigger.chap3MarcPressesXu
Xu:Woah, woah.  Really, Marc?  You're going to play that card?
Xu:....
Xu:Jesus, you're serious.
Xu:Alright, fine.  But you better keep this to yourself.
Xu:I originally came here on a student visa to go to college.  Being admitted and getting the visa were...extremely expensive.
Xu:And then I fucked it up.  Flunked out during my junior year.
Xu:I couldn't go back home like that.  Not after everything my family did to get me here.
Xu:So I just...disappeared.  Crossed the border and looked for whatever job I could get.
Xu:Which was basically just this one.  So, here I am.
