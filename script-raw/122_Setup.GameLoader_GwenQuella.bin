Quella:It's alright.  I kind of think all cities are the same to a large extent.
Quella:It has more to do with where you're living in that city.
Quella:My neighborhood isn't bad.

action end

action:statement:root-1-C
Quella:I'm just trying to clear my head by getting out of the city.
Quella:It also allows me to focus more on my book.
Quella:My family hated the idea, but it's been really good for me.

Quella:Nowhere in particular.  After we land I'll be hotel-hopping a bit.
Quella:Eventually I'll head back home.
Quella:It'd be great if I could finish my first draft before then.

Gwen
chap4-C:You have to believe me.  I didn't do it.:trigger.chap4gwenQuellaProgress.on
chap4-D:I never saw that key before in my life.
chap4-E:The real killer must still be out there...
</>chap4-null:...Never mind.
action end

action:statement:chap4-C
Quella:I do believe you, Gwen.  I don't think you could have done it.
Quella:The question is, how do we prove that?
next:chap4-B
action end

action:statement:chap4-D
Quella:I've been wondering if someone may have planted the key in your room while you were sleeping.
Quella:Do you have any thoughts about that?
next:chap4-D-1
action end

action:response:chap4-D-1
Gwen
chap4-B:That sounds likely, but I don't have any idea who would have done that.
chap4-trigger.chap4MarcConfessedPlant:Marcurio admitted to me that he planted the key.
action end

action:statement:chap4-trigger.chap4MarcConfessedPlant
Quella:What?  Really?!
Quella:That's crazy.  I can't believe he'd admit it to you.  He must be really confident the others will take his side if we called him on it.
Quella:If one crew member was a part of this, I wonder if Xu or Alton were as well...?
next:chap4-B
action end

action:statement:chap4-E
Quella:That's what worries me most.
Quella:If you're being framed, there's no reason to think any of us are safe on this ship.

</>chap5-null:Never mind.

action:response:chap5-innocent
Gwen
chap5-innocent-A:So many others thought I was suspicious.  Why didn't you?
</>chap5-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:chap5-innocent-A
Quella:I could just tell, when I talked to you.
Quella:I knew you weren't the kind to hurt anybody.  It's as simple as that.
next:chap5
action end

action:statement:chap5-B
Quella:Thanks.  I will.
Quella:After everything that's happened, it's hard to see how a good outcome is possible.
Quella:But I try to have faith.

action:statement:chap5-B-2
Quella:...I don't know.
Quella:I try to remind myself, this world is good.  People are good.
Quella:Somehow, it'll work out.  Even if it takes a miracle.
next:chap5-B-1
action end

action:statement:chap5-trigger.chap5gwenQuellaProgress
Quella:That's fair.  There's probably no such thing.
Quella:It's silly, but I still like to think there's someone watching out for us.

Quella:About as well as I could hope, thanks.
