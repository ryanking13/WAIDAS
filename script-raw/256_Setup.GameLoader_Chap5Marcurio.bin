root-trigger.chap5XuConfession:I took bribes from the same person Sue did.
root-A:You're gonna just shoot everyone?  Have you lost your fucking mind?!
root-B:What if you're wrong about all of this?  Huh?
root-C:So what's your end game here?
</>root-null:Never mind.

root-B-2:What if there is no serial killer on board?  What if it's something else completely?
root-B-3:What if your profile or whatever is wrong?

action:statement:root-B-2
Donovan:The serial killer is on board.
Donovan:Paulo's injuries match up with his previous victims.  And that kind of information is something few people would know.
Donovan:Maybe I didn't find the captain, but I was still right all along.

Donovan:I have it on very high authority that the person I'm after is a man.
Donovan:It's not much to go off of, but it narrows things down just enough.

root-marcConfession-A:Everything was anonymous.  I don't know who it was.
root-marcConfession-B:I was the one that received the second copy of the master key.
root-marcConfession-C:I was instructed to plant the key in Gwen's room, in order to put her under suspicion.:trigger.chap5MarcConfession.on
<!>root-trigger.chap5MarcConfession:They must have taken the kid before they sent the key, obviously.  So it was completely intentional.:trigger.chap5MarcConfession2.on

Donovan:Of course.  And you were the perfect little grunt, never bothering to consider what you were really doing.
Donovan:Much less who you were truly working for.

root-marcConfession-B-2:No, I don't.  It was dropped off in the middle of last night.
action end

Donovan:Not long after I had been disposed of.
Donovan:That must have been the killer.

Donovan:It's a good thing that didn't stick.
Donovan:But if they were trying to distance themselves from this, why abduct the kid too?
Donovan:Those two actions seem to go directly against each other...
next:root-marcConfession
action end

action:statement:root-trigger.chap5MarcConfession
Donovan:You're right...there was no accident there.
Donovan:But it seems like a contradiction.  If the plan was to give away the key and lay low, why take an additional victim?
Donovan:Something's missing from this...
