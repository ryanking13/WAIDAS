null:Inside the box are various handwritten notes.
null:They all have vague instructions regarding dropping off items or supplies.
null:One note has instructions for leaving the boat's docking ramp out overnight before the ship had disembarked.
null:In each case, few specifics are given, but a payment for these services is referenced.
Marcurio:Keeping these around hasn't done me much good.

null:The forms all have tables counting the kitchen stock.  This much grain, this much chicken, and so on.
null:It's not very interesting to read through.
null:Several papers in, there's writing with red ink everywhere.  Numbers are crossed out and other numbers are written over them.
null:These ledgers are almost completely inaccurate.  I will be coming to check the kitchen stock more often from now on.
Marcurio:That was the captain for you.  Always so diligent.
Marcurio:What did she care if a little food went missing here and there?
