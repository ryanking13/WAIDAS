Garv-Marcurio

action:response:root
Garv
root-1:How's your pay?  Are you happy here?
root-2:What was your opinion of the captain?
</>root-null:Goodbye.
action end

action:statement:root-1
Marcurio:Pay's not good, but I manage.  Working here has its advantages.
Marcurio:The lack of passengers here means I often have the kitchen all to myself.
Marcurio:I may still be on work hours, but I have time to do my own stuff.  Study.  Practice.
Marcurio:At least, as far as our meager supplies and ingredients allow me to.
next:root-1-A
action end

action:response:root-1-A
Garv
root-1-B:You haven't thought of another job?
root-1-C:You've never thought about...forcing the issue of a raise to the captain?
</>root-null:Goodbye.
action end

action:statement:root-1-B
Marcurio:What, are you offering me a job or something?  Unless you own a restaraunt, I'm not interested.
Marcurio:Sure, I'd like to get out of here and work somewhere classier, but that's easier said than done.
next:root-1-A
action end

action:statement:root-1-C
Marcurio:What exactly are you getting at?
Marcurio:I'm not crazy about my pay, but that's a secondary concern to me.
Marcurio:I would never do anything stupid just for cash.
next:root-1-D
action end

action:response:root-1-D
Garv
root-1-E:Everyone has their price.
action end

action:statement:root-1-E
Marcurio:Maybe.  But mine is pretty high.
next:root-null
action end


action:statement:root-2
Marcurio:Honestly?  She seemed a little clueless.
Marcurio:About how the ship works, sure, but also about everything in general.
Marcurio:She had some weird ideas about how to improve this ship that were just...strange.
Marcurio:Not sure why someone so bright-eyed became captain of a shit-pile like this in the first place.
next:root-2-A
action end

action:response:root-2-A
Garv
root-2-B:Weird ideas?  Would you say they were ideas that had to be...stopped?
<!>root-2-C:You don't seem very cut up about her disappearance.
</>root-null:Goodbye.
action end

action:statement:root-2-B
Marcurio:I hope you're trying to be funny with that veiled accusation.
Marcurio:It's not like I ever cared one way or the other about her stupid ideas.
Marcurio:In fact, if they worked, which they weren't going to, it would only benefit me.
Marcurio:But no kind of management could make this an actual, successful cruise ship.
next:root-2-A
action end

action:statement:root-2-C
Marcurio:Hey, I feel bad about this situation.  Everyone does.
Marcurio:But making a show of it doesn't help anyone.  Least of all the captain.
Marcurio:It's also not like I can do anything about it.  I'm not a cop, and I don't solve murders.
Marcurio:I'm just the cook.
next:root-3-C
action end

action:response:root-3-C
Garv
root-3-D:I see.  You're just going to keep your head down and wait things out.  Smart.:trigger.chap3MarcUnlocked.on
action end

action:statement:root-3-D
Marcurio:Yeah, that's right.  I wouldn't have expected a geezer like you to understand that.
Marcurio:I've seen people die for having the wrong friends, or stick up for the wrong person.
Marcurio:I learned a long time ago to mind my own damn business.  There's no point acting like a hero.
Marcurio:I'm just trying to do my job, here.
next:root-null
action end

Garv
root2-1:How's your pay?  Do you like working here?
root2-A:Do you really think the ship will stay open after this?
</>root2-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root2-1
Marcurio:Pay's not good, but I manage.  Working here has its advantages.

action end

action:statement:root2-A
Marcurio:You mean you think it'll close down?  Maybe.
Marcurio:Honestly, I don't know how this ship has managed to stay open so long in the first place.
Marcurio:I don't even know who owns this ship.  They might find a way.
next:root2-A-1
action end

action:response:root2-A-1
Garv
root2-A-2:You don't know who the owner is?:trigger.chap4garvMarcProgress.on
root2-trigger.chap4garvMarcProgress:Then...where do the paychecks come from?
root2-A-3:I doubt anyone would want to be associated with this mess.
</>root2-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root2-A-2
Marcurio:Nope.
Marcurio:The captain is technically an employee, just like me.
Marcurio:The actual owner of the boat...I've never had to deal directly with them.
next:root2-A-1
action end

action:statement:root2-trigger.chap4garvMarcProgress
Marcurio:Eh...well...
Marcurio:I don't exactly get paychecks.  I just get paid in hard cash.
Marcurio:It makes everything a lot...simpler.
next:root2-A-1
action end

action:statement:root2-A-3
Marcurio:You think we'll get dropped for image reasons?
Marcurio:I hope not.  But who knows anymore, you might be right.
