Ferdinand:Good morning, passengers!  This is your friendly first mate Ferdinand speaking!
Ferdinand:I would like to ask all staff and passengers onto the B1 floor for an important announcement!
Ferdinand:I could make the announcement via intercom, but I feel this is a matter that requires a face to face talk.
Ferdinand:Thank you, and I'll see you very soon!

Ferdinand:Hello everyone!
Ferdinand:As the first mate of this fine vessel, I must inform the crew of any notable events!
Ferdinand:And so it happens that right now, we find ourselves in just such a -
Marcurio:*cough cough COUGH*
Ferdinand:...Right.
Ferdinand:Yesterday, our lovely captain was not in the pilothouse all day.
Ferdinand:In her absence, it is my duty to fill her shoes and pilot the ship.  For the time being.
Ferdinand:However, rest assured that this is no cause for alarm!  I am sure the captain is fine.
Ferdinand:She is most certainly on the ship somewhere. Yup. Right as rain.
Ferdinand:If the staff would look for her in their off-hours, I am sure things will be back to normal by nightfall.
Ferdinand:Now I must head to the pilothouse.  Enjoy your cruise!

Quella:Is that...is that true?  The captain is missing?
Xu:Actually, I didn't see her yesterday either. Not that I was looking, but...
Marcurio:We won't know anything for sure until we've searched the ship.

Alton:But the captain has to be somewhere, right?

Garv:Yeah, strange.  I'm sure he heard the announcement on the intercom.
