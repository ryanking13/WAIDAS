action:statement:root-day1
Ferdinand:Hmm, the captain was last seen three days ago.  That's a long time to be absent.
Ferdinand:I guess that rules out my theory that she was just using the restroom.
Ferdinand:Let's see...at night, after a break the captain left her room and went up to the first floor.
Ferdinand:There isn't any footage on that floor, so I don't know what she did next.
Ferdinand:Between the time when she left and the next morning, every single person went up to the first floor and came back down.
Ferdinand:So really, this footage can't be used to prove anyone did it.  How disappointing!
next:root-camera2

action:statement:root-day2
Ferdinand:A couple things happened two days ago.
Ferdinand:Alton and Sue were walking all around the place talking to people.
Ferdinand:Quella was also particularly busy, walking all around talking to people.
Ferdinand:And then that evening, Gwen broke into this room.  Against all my best advice I might add!
next:root-days
action end

action:statement:root-day3
Ferdinand:Yesterday...that was an interesting day.
Ferdinand:At the crack of dawn, there I am entering Garv's room.  I guess he saw that, huh?
Ferdinand:Then that morning, there I am having a meeting with everyone and explaining the situation.
Ferdinand:Later on, there's footage of Donovan walking all around the place.
Ferdinand:It looks like he used the master key to enter the captain's room, and even my room!  So naughty!
Ferdinand:But then in the evening he goes up to the first floor...never to return.
Ferdinand:Then the footage cuts out.  Looks like someone found his little toys and turned them off.
next:root-days
action end

action:statement:root-day4
Ferdinand:Woops!  There isn't any footage for today.
Ferdinand:It looks like someone must've found all those cameras last night and turned them off.
Ferdinand:I suppose it's no coincidence that this happened right after Donovan's disappearance...
Ferdinand:Now I wonder, who could have done something like that?

action:statement:root-cameraB1
Ferdinand:This is the lowest floor, where all passengers stay.
Ferdinand:As expected, there's a lot of people moving in and out of their rooms from day to day.
Ferdinand:The only constant is that black cat, which wanders around everywhere.
Ferdinand:Sometimes it's carrying small objects in its mouth...it's a small-time thief, I guess.
Ferdinand:There really isn't anything suspicious that goes on down here from day to day, though.
next:root-cameras
action end

action:statement:root-cameraB2
Ferdinand:This is the middle floor, where all the staff stay.
Ferdinand:Usually people are walking through here to reach the upper deck, where I don't have any cameras.
Ferdinand:Marcurio and Garv are always going in and out of the broom closet for cleaning supplies.
Ferdinand:Almost every day since we've disembarked, in fact.
Ferdinand:Darryl walks through here once or twice a day, but spends all day on the upper deck.

null:Hey, Donovan.  It's been a long time since we've spoken.
null:I hope you're doing better since you left the force.  I know it's been rough.
null:Truth is, I'm contacting you because I need your help.  Something has come up which requires...a special touch.
null:It's him, Donovan.
null:Let me know if you can help.

null:I've tracked him down to a small cruise ship.  Of sorts.
null:However, it's across the border, so it's out of our jurisdiction.  By the time we can coordinate an effort, he'll be gone.
null:I'd throw away my badge and go after him myself, but I got close to him.  My identity was compromised.
null:I need someone from outside that he doesn't know.  You're the only one who can do this, Donovan.
null:It's been a long time since he's struck, and it's possible he'll regard this isolated ship as a prime opportunity.
null:Attached, you'll find everything you need to know in order to get there.  The rest is on you.

null:Oh, and...one last thing, Donovan.
null:I know you blame me for your dismissal.  But you weren't okay, Donovan.  You needed the break.
null:Maybe you're still bitter.  But keep this in mind...
null:I'm breaking a lot of regulations, and personal standards, enlisting your help like this.  I'm putting a lot of trust in you.
null:So please, be professional about this.  Don't do anything reckless.  Get the job done, and come home.
null:For me.
