Marcurio:I'm just glad you were able to reach us at all in this weather.
Marcurio:There's no way any of us could've steered that thing to a dock, much less navigate there.
Marcurio:How's everyone holding up?

Xu:...
Gwen:....
Marcurio:Yeah...same here.
Xu:They didn't do anything wrong, Marc.  They were innocent.
Xu:We were the ones that were guilty!  It's...
Xu:It's our fault they're gone...

Gwen:He still isn't responding to anything...he just keeps staring straight ahead.
Gwen:And he almost never says anything.  He just repeats things...
Xu:What happened down there?  What did he see?
Xu:I don't understand any of it...
Paulo:...a...n...y...o...f...i...t...
Marcurio:I know it's hard, but we have to stay focused for now.  We can try and figure the rest out later.
Marcurio:And...maybe it's best if we let someone else put the pieces together.
Paulo:...p...i...e...c...e...s...t...o...g...e...t...h...e...r...

Gwen:I don't know if I can do that.
Gwen:Something else happened there.  On the ship.   There was more going on.
Gwen:I need to understand what happened.  I need it to make sense.
Gwen:Just leaving it behind like that...it's not right.

// Ferdinand epilogue  ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

dialogue start
FerdinandEpilogue

action:statement:root
Marcurio:I never thought I'd see solid land again, after all of that.
Xu:Thank god Darryl could dock the boat, or I don't know what we'd do.
Darryl:I guess my short-lived sailboating days were of some use after all.
next:root-null
action end

action:statement:root2
Alton:So...what now?
Marcurio:Well, the local authorities have been called, and should be on their way.
Marcurio:Maybe they'll be able to make sense of everything.
Xu:It looks like Donovan got what he wanted, in the end.  The serial killer that he thought was on the boat...
Alton:I...I can't believe Ferdinand really...he really did all of that.  Did he kill the captain, too?
Gwen:Most likely.  He enjoyed manipulating people, and watching them suffer.  It's who he was - everything else was a lie.
Garv:To think, he was just putting on an act that entire time.  And the horrific things he did...
Quella:But did he need to die?  He could have been taken into custody.  And Donovan...
Darryl:There's nothing we could have done.  He had given up a long time ago.
Darryl:Maybe this is the best outcome we could have hoped for.
Quella:The best outcome...for us, maybe.  But what about all of those people?
next:root-null
action end

action:statement:root3
Marcurio:I can't stay on this boat.  Not after everything I've seen.
Marcurio:But I'll find work.  And if I never understand what happened back there, well, I'm okay with that.
Alton:I guess the important thing is that it's over.  Ferdinand's...gone, and nobody else will be hurt.
Garv:That's right.  What happened was a shame, but at least Donovan got what he wanted in the end.
Garv:Nothing could bring the captain back, but we do have closure.
Darryl:Closure, huh?  Yeah...I guess so.

// Garv epilogue  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

dialogue start
GarvEpilogue

action:statement:root
Ferdinand:Here we are, safe and sound!  Please be careful as you exit the ship.
Marcurio:Good thing it only took a couple hours and multiple tries to dock.  Where did you get your license, anyway?
Ferdinand:...Well, the important thing is we're here, right?
next:root-null
action end

action:statement:root2
Xu:The authorities should arrive in a few hours.  They'll be able to take care of all those people.
Alton:Was Donovan telling the truth?  About...why they were there?
Quella:Human trafficking.  Sexual slavery.  I've heard of those things.  But to see all of that with my own eyes...
Gwen:So cruel.  Garv didn't even blink at the thought of what would happen to those poor women.
Darryl:Of course not.  He had been drugging and beating them.  He knew what he was doing.
Marcurio:It was happening under our feet this whole time.  And we let it.  Enabled it.
Marcurio:He was right about that part.  We...I...helped create that.  That's the truth.
Ferdinand:Perhaps.  But now you know the truth - and you can work to fix it!
Ferdinand:Whatever our faults, and whatever my faults, Garv was the real evil.
Ferdinand:I'm sure if the captain was here, she'd be pleased.  She could have closure, at last!

Marcurio:The authorities should arrive in a few hours.  They'll be able to take care of all those people.
Marcurio:Once they do, I'm out of here.  This ship can sink into the ocean for all I care.
Alton:I can't believe it.  Both Ferdinand and Garv...the things they did, and they didn't even pretend to feel guilt.
Darryl:They made quite the team.  A serial killer and a businessman.  Hard to tell which of the two was worse.
Quella:Darryl, Gwen...if you hadn't come forward, who knows what would have happened to us.
Quella:The information you gave brought us to the truth.  Thank you.
Gwen:I remember having help along the way more than once.  Thanks, Quella.
Xu:I just wish Donovan was still here.  He didn't deserve to end like that.  The captain didn't, either.
Quella:Yeah.  If it wasn't for them, we'd never have found out what was really happening.
Quella:It can't all be fixed.  And a lot of it will take time.  But...we can start to make things right.
Quella:There won't be any more victims, now.  The nightmare is over.
