Ferdinand:Ohoho, now that is an interesting question!  Very interesting indeed!
Ferdinand:Truth be told, I have been curious about this very question since setting board this vessel!
Ferdinand:You see, this ship used to be used to smuggle certain illegal substances across borders.  I am almost certain.
Ferdinand:This comes with the possibility that there are unknown areas of the ship that were used to hide these substances.

action:statement:root-chap3SecretArea-1
Ferdinand:Good question.  Any good smuggling compartment should be very well disguised - otherwise, it's not very useful, is it?
Ferdinand:That said, some things cannot be helped.  For instance, it could impact the weighting and balance of the ship.
Ferdinand:In addition, some parts of the ship would be hollow when they otherwise shouldn't.
Ferdinand:A hidden compartment needs space, obviously, and that has to come from somewhere.
next:root-chap3SecretArea
action end

action:statement:root-chap3SecretArea-2
Ferdinand:Where?  No.  I do not know if, indeed, they exist.  But I hope.
Ferdinand:Logic would dictate that any compartment should be easily accessible, despite being well hidden.
Ferdinand:Especially if there were large packages being moved, one would expect they need to be hidden quickly and smoothly.
Ferdinand:I doubt the smugglers would be very keen on moving it through too many doors or up and down stairs.
Ferdinand:I'd expect to find a hole of some sort where they could simply drop things down and retrieve them later.

Marcurio:For money.  Whoever was anonymously sending instructions would also send handsome payments at the end.
Marcurio:And honestly, it's been going on for a long time.  Since before the captain even worked on this ship.
Ferdinand:Well, this is incredibly suspicious, don't you think?  Why, it adds a completely different dimension to our entire situation!
Ferdinand:As for Gwen...perhaps it is not her, but the two of you who should be restrained in the observation room.
Ferdinand:What sort of employees keep such secrets from their superiors?!  And at such a critical time!
Marcurio:Sure, sure.  The real issue is, what are you going to do with this information now?

Ferdinand:I'd have no need to bribe someone to plant a key in Gwen's room.  I could do it myself!
Marcurio:Also, I got my orders while the ship was at sea, so obviously it has to be someone on the ship now.
Ferdinand:That implies it must be one of the ship's residents...but which one?
next:root3-concession-6

action:statement:root3-concession-B
Marcurio:You have to admit, there's nothing directly linking the two.
Marcurio:Like I said, these orders have been coming in for a long time - it's not a new occurence.
Ferdinand:Sure, but if this person wanted Gwen incriminated...it sounds like an attempt to throw suspicion off themselves.
Ferdinand:That's a pretty strong connection in my opinion.
Marcurio:If you say so.
next:root3-concession-6

action:statement:root3-concession-C
Marcurio:We know now that Gwen is innocent, but not a whole lot else.  So how much has really changed?
Marcurio:If we can't be certain who the culprit is, we don't have much choice but to wait until we've landed.
Marcurio:We can lock the ship down until authorities have carried out an investigation and questioned everybody.
Ferdinand:Not the ideal course of action.  I'd like to revisit the evidence with this new information.
Ferdinand:But I have to admit, if we can't prove one person is guilty, I'm not sure what there is to do.

Marcurio:W-what?!  You never mentioned this to me before, Sue!
Ferdinand:You know where to find it?  That's incredible news.  And if Donovan perished in his search for this area, that implies there's something to find there.
Ferdinand:Perhaps something that your anonymous donor wants to remain hidden, no?
Marcurio:If Donovan went missing looking for it, then that's all the more reason we should steer clear of it!  Let the guys with guns and badges investigate it.
Ferdinand:That's not a bad point.  We need to think about our own safety, as well as that of the passengers.
Ferdinand:...
Ferdinand:I've got it!
Ferdinand:What if everyone went into this hidden area together?  Safety in numbers, and all that.
Ferdinand:If one of the people on the ship is a murderer, they won't be able to try anything funny - they'll be completely outnumbered.
Marcurio:You can't be serious.  What, we just round up everyone and march them around?

Ferdinand:Once we put this plan in motion, there's no telling what will happen or what we will find.
