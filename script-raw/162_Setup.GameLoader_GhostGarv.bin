Garv:Ah yes, I saw her last night.  I remember it well.
Garv:She was admonishing me about how pets aren't allowed on board.

Garv:There's no certainty, but it's quite possible the captain was done in by someone.
Garv:If that's the case, the sooner we act on that knowledge, the better.

Garv:She was a straight arrow, that's for sure.

Garv:Look around you.  Look at the people.  You know where you are?
Garv:You're in purgatory.  We all are, and we all know it.  Somewhere, things went wrong and that's why we're on this dump.
Garv:The only thing any of us want is to get out of here and move on with our lives.
Garv:The captain...really thought she was doing something important.  She wanted to turn this place around.
Garv:Isn't that a little sad?
next:root2-captain2
action end

action:statement:root2-captain2-B
Garv:Well enough, at first.  Then she found out about my pets.
Garv:Apparently this ship has a strict no-pets policy, but it's the first time I ever heard of it.
Garv:The old staff never cared.  But she had to do everything by the book, right?
Garv:That was the captain for you.

Garv:I think I recall hearing about that briefly somewhere.
Garv:But I'm just a passenger.  I don't really know much about the ship.

root3-B2:What doubts?
root3-B3:Who do you think is guilty?
root3-B4:How can Gwen be proven innocent?
</>root3-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root3-B2
Garv:The only evidence that points to Gwen was the key found in her room.
Garv:But it would have been extremely simple to plant the key.
Garv:In reality, there's almost nothing that actually tells us Gwen murdered two people last night.
next:root3-B1
action end

action:statement:root3-B3
Garv:Considering how Gwen was found guilty, I'd say it's very likely a staff member is guilty...or at least involved in some way.
Garv:If a staff member planted the key in Gwen's room, they could be absolutely sure it was found during the search of the ship.
Garv:The search also seemed a little sudden, considering how slow everyone was to react when the captain turned up missing.
next:root3-B1
action end

action:statement:root3-B4
Garv:If it was revealed that Gwen didn't take the key from Donovan, that would be enough.
Garv:The ship staff were the ones who found it.  I would be willing to bet that one of them is complicit in her framing.
Garv:If they told the truth, I think we'd come much closer to finding the true killer.
next:root3-B2
action end

action:statement:root3-C
Garv:If Donovan was looking for the captain, it's possible the culprit got rid of him to cover their tracks.
Garv:I couldn't tell you about Paulo.  He seemed to be holed up in his room all day, so I don't know where he fits into that.
Garv:But it seems like the work of someone who is indiscriminate and doesn't premeditate things...a killer.
next:root3
action end

action:statement:root3-D
Garv:Definitely not sit around and wait for the ship to land.
Garv:If I'm right, the murderer is still quite free to walk around here.
Garv:When we reach land, he or she will likely slip through our fingers and we can say goodbye to finding the truth.
Garv:Not to mention the distinct possibility that more people become victims before we get that far...
Garv:No.  We need to clear Gwen's name and continue an investigation.
Garv:Dare I say, we should pick up wherever Donovan left off.

Garv:That's exactly right.  Everyone has a price.  They'll stab you in the back if there's a half-good reason.
Garv:When I was younger I thought the opposite.  I was naive.  But I learned the truth.
Garv:It started with my marriage.  She had been lying to me for years.
Garv:And when she lied to the court, they gave her the kids and the house.
Garv:Next was my career.  I wasn't much of a politician back then, and company politics was everything.
Garv:When I had everything, people were great to me.  But when I had nothing, they were all gone.
