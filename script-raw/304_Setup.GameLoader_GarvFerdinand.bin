Garv
root-1-B:I imagine being the captain would be a step up.
</>root-null:Goodbye.
action end

action:statement:root-1-B
Ferdinand:Perhaps, perhaps.  The captain does have more responsibility and control over the ship.
Ferdinand:But everything in due course, as I say.  We are given responsibilities only according to our abilities.
Ferdinand:Someday I'd like to be a captain, but until then I am content as I am!

Garv
root-1-D:You haven't thought about...accelerating your promotion?
</>root-null:Goodbye.

action:statement:root-1-D
Ferdinand:...I hope you are not implying what I think you are.
Ferdinand:Perhaps the subordinate usually benefits from their superior's absence, but sailing is a collaborative enterprise!
Ferdinand:I would wish no harm on the captain for something as petty as title!
Ferdinand:In fact, the thought thoroughly repulses me!  I am repulsed!
next:root-null
action end

action:statement:root-2
Ferdinand:What makes a fish want to swim?  What makes a bird want to fly?  What makes a skunk want to expel odorous gasses?
Ferdinand:It is in my bones, as simple as that!  I have yearned for the great big blue for as long as I can remember.
Ferdinand:If you are looking for a baser, lesser motivation you are searching in vain, my friend.
