Marcurio:Listen.
Marcurio:I don't know exactly what you've been through, but I can probably relate.  A little.
Marcurio:But other people - they don't know.  Or they don't care.  And they definitely don't understand.
Marcurio:You have to...find some other way to deal with it.

Marcurio:My family was kind of a mess.
Marcurio:My dad had some...issues.  And he had, well, his own way of dealing with it.
Marcurio:He'd beat me 'til I was bloody, using anything in arms reach.
Marcurio:There were times I really thought he'd kill me.  Maybe he thought he would too.

action:statement:chap4-thePast-1
Marcurio:Who could I tell?  And how would it help?

Marcurio:You wouldn't say that if you met me five, ten years ago.
Marcurio:I was messed up.  Real messed up, and desperate.  I did some dumb things.

Marcurio:Yeah.  I do.  But there's still a lot you don't know about me.
Marcurio:You know what, here.  I'll let you in on a secret.
Marcurio:I know it wasn't you.
Marcurio:...
Marcurio:Because I was the one that planted the key in your room.

action:statement:chap4-marcConfess-2
Marcurio:That's the last thing I'm going to do.
Marcurio:Look, Gwen, we had a moment just now.  We've both been through some shit.  And that's great.
Marcurio:But this is a different matter entirely.  This is business.
Marcurio:There are forces larger than both of us at work here.  My advice for you is to just go along with it.
Marcurio:You're not going to come to harm.  If you're innocent, which I know you are, you'll be let go by the police after their investigation.
Marcurio:...Probably.
Marcurio:But until then, this little play has to keep on going.
next:chap4-marcConfess
action end

action:statement:chap4-marcConfess-3
Marcurio:Well, I thought you should know.  You deserve the truth.
Marcurio:It's nothing personal - I'm really just following instructions.
Marcurio:But I'm mainly telling you because there's literally nothing you can do about it.
Marcurio:You just try and tell people I planted the key.  Go on!  They won't believe you.  It's your word against mine.
Marcurio:Just keep calm, and this whole thing will be over before you know it.  Okay?  Okay.

Marcurio:It wouldn't accomplish anything.
Marcurio:All I did was follow orders.  And I wasn't the only one getting 'em.

Marcurio:Whoever it is, they're good at being discrete.
Marcurio:Donovan had free reign of the ship, could've snuck into any of our rooms and searched anything...
Marcurio:And still, someone got the jump on him.
Marcurio:To catch someone like this...you'd have to be monitoring the ship all the time.
Marcurio:Now, if we had security camera footage...that'd make this all pretty straightforward, huh?
