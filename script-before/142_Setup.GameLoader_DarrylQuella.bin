Darryl
root-1:How's the book going?
<!>root-B:You said you know what death looks like.  What does that mean?
</>root-null:See you later.
action end

action:statement:root-1
Quella:Usually when people ask I try to sound optimistic, but...
Quella:...it's awful.
Quella:I feel like the idea is good, but I'm unable to make it real.
Quella:My writing just feels so clumsy and...inadequate.
Quella:Sometimes I spend entire evenings mulling over one scene, but still don't complete it.
Quella:And at the end of the day, I'm scared that I'm just writing a boring book.

Darryl
root-3:I think that's common for beginning writers.
root-4:No one said it would be easy.
root-5:I believe in you.
</>root-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root-3
Quella:I don't know if I'd call myself a beginner.
Quella:Maybe it will get better with time, but that's not something I have a lot of.
next:root-2
action end

action:statement:root-4
Quella:True.  No one said it would be like this, though.
Quella:I usually had so much fun writing...but now it feels like torture.
next:root-2
action end

action:statement:root-5
Quella:Thanks.  I appreciate it.
next:root-2
action end


action:statement:root-B
Quella:I know, it sounds really dramatic.
Quella:I just mean...people that have come to terms with their death act differently.  They see the world in a different way.
Quella:You struck me as that kind of person.
next:root-B-2
action end

action:response:root-B-2
Darryl
root-B-3:And how do you know so much about this?
action end

action:statement:root-B-3
Quella:Well, I've got several months left to live, so there's that.
next:root-B-4
action end

action:response:root-B-4
Darryl
root-B-5:...What?:trigger.chap3quellaConfession.on
action end

action:statement:root-B-5
Quella:Yeah, I've got cancer pretty much all over my body.
Quella:It's the liver cancer that's gonna do it, though.  Not gonna lie, my liver's a total mess.
Quella:I think I'm looking at three or four months, now.
next:root-B-6
action end

action:response:root-B-6
Darryl
root-C:Have you been treated?
root-D:Why aren't you back with your family?
root-E:...I'm so sorry to hear that.
action end

action:statement:root-C
Quella:Couldn't afford health insurance.  Obviously without that, couldn't afford treatment.
Quella:Considering that, I've had a pretty long run.  Cancer is persistent, but it can be slow too.
next:root-C-1
action end

action:response:root-C-1
Darryl
root-C-2:I can afford it.  I'll help you pay for whatever you need.
action end

action:statement:root-C-2
Quella:Hahaha!
Quella:No, I appreciate it, I really do, but...it's too late for that.
Quella:By this point the cancer must've spread everywhere.  There isn't much that can be done now.
next:root-B-6
action end

action:statement:root-D
Quella:I've spent lots of time with them since I first got the news.
Quella:But I also wanted to spend some time with myself, just writing.
Quella:When it comes time, I'll head back and see everyone again.  Say my goodbyes.
next:root-B-6
action end

action:statement:root-E
Quella:Aww, don't get like that.  It's just how life goes sometimes.
next:root-F
action end

action:response:root-F
Darryl
root-G:You're so...upbeat about this.:trigger.chap3QuellaUnlocked.on
action end

action:statement:root-G
Quella:I guess it could look that way.  I've just gotten used to it.
Quella:It took a while.  At first I was devastated, of course.
Quella:Eventually it sunk in that this was going to happen, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.
Quella:That this...is all I have.  All I'm ever going to have.
Quella:I had to come to terms with that.  I had to continue living, and be happy, despite that.
Quella:It was the hardest thing I've ever done, but it was worth it.
next:root-null
action end



action:response:root2
Darryl
root2-A:Why write?  I mean, given everything...why now?
root2-B:Can I read any of it?  Your story?
</>root2-null:Talk to you later.
action end

action:statement:root2-A
Quella:That's an odd question.  If not now, when?
Quella:I know it's pointless.  I don't have nearly enough time, really.
Quella:What I'm writing...may not even be any good!
Quella:But I love it.  It's all I want to do.
next:root2
action end

action:statement:root2-B
Quella:...Really?  You want to?
Quella:I mean, it's so far from finished, I mean, I don't think you'd like it.
next:root2-C
action end

action:response:root2-C
Darryl
root2-D:You have to show it to somebody eventually.
root2-E:I'm sure I'll like it.  I could even help you edit it.
</>root2-null:Never mind then.
action end

action:statement:root2-D
Quella:I know, I know...it just needs a little bit more time!
Quella:I'm about to get a big revision done.  Maybe after that would be better.
next:root2-C
action end

action:statement:root2-E
Quella:Hmm...it would be good to have fresh eyes read it over.
Quella:I know I can get stuck in a rut.  Maybe what I need is an editor.
Quella:I...I'll think about it.
Quella:...Thank you.
