Gwen
root-A-2:설명하기 좀 어려워요.  누군가 나를 쫓아오고 있다고 생각해어요.  피해망상이었죠.
root-trigger.chap6FerdEnd3:Ferdinand가 당신이 의심스럽다고 했어요.  그래서 그한테 제가 당신 방에서 본 걸 말했죠.

Donovan:아무렴.
Donovan:뭐 그 망상이 완전히 잘못된 건 아니었어.  방향이 좀 틀렸을 뿐이지.
Donovan:어쨌든, 살인자는 배 안에 있었으니.

Donovan:I expect the person who ambushed me knew I had the master key.  That's how they anticipated me.
Donovan:At that time, Sue knew because I got the key from her.  And you knew because you broke into my room.
Donovan:But neither of you fit the profile.
Donovan:But Ferdinand...he fits the profile.  And he knew.
Donovan:Why did you tell him?
Gwen:He made me scared.  I think he knew that if he did, I might do something rash...
Ferdinand:T-that's not what happened!  I merely confided in her that the captain was missing.
Ferdinand:I personally disapproved of her actions!  I never told her to do anything!
Donovan:Even so, you set her against me.  And you knew I had the master key.
Donovan:You were the only suspect with that information.
Ferdinand:Well, perhaps, but what if she told someone else?  Or what if...what if I told someone else?
