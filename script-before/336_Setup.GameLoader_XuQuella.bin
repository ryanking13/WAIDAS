Xu
root-1:You've got a lot of trash paper.
root-2:So...you're a writer I take it?
</>root-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root-1
Quella:Hahaha!  You saw my trash bin, I guess.
Quella:Yeah, I'm writing a story and I can never decide how to word things.  I end up throwing a lot away.
next:root-null
action end

action:statement:root-2
Quella:I'm trying to be.  I don't know if you can call yourself a writer when you haven't finished writing anything.
next:root-3
action end

action:response:root-3
Xu
root-3-A:But you do write things, yeah?
root-3-B:How does that work out for you, money-wise?
</>root-3-null:I'll let you get back to that then.
action end

action:statement:root-3-A
Quella:I have been working on a novel, and I do hope to get it published.
Quella:But...it feels like I do more re-writing than actual writing.
Quella:Sometimes it feels like I'm never going to finish it.
next:root-3
action end

action:statement:root-3-B
Quella:Money-wise?  It doesn't work out.
Quella:I don't get paid just for writing, of course.  I have to finish a book and get it published.
Quella:But I haven't finished, don't know when I will, and even then I won't have a publisher.
Quella:So...it's rough.
next:root-4
action end

action:response:root-4
Xu
root-4-A:Then how do you support yourself?:trigger.quellasSavings.on
root-4-trigger.quellasSavings:What happens after you run out of money?
root-4-trigger.quellasSavings-1:You seem really calm about going broke.
<!>root-4-B:So why do you do write?:trigger.unlockQuella.on
action end

action:statement:root-4-A
Quella:I have some money saved up.  I'm burning through it, though.
Quella:I think I have...oh, four or five months left, and then I'm broke.
next:root-4
action end

action:statement:root-4-trigger.quellasSavings
Quella:I haven't thought too much about it!
Quella:I'm just focusing on writing as much as I possibly can before that happens.
next:root-4
action end

action:statement:root-4-trigger.quellasSavings-1
Quella:I am.
Quella:Maybe it seems a bit crazy or reckless, but in truth it's freeing.
Quella:Writing is my dream.  There is nothing I'd rather do.
Quella:I'd rather try and fail at this than spend the rest of my life doing something I dislike.
next:root-4
action end

action:statement:root-4-B
Quella:That's a good question.  I guess the short answer is, I like writing.
Quella:But that isn't to say it's fun.  It's often very tedious...so much rewriting!
Quella:And there isn't much money in it.
Quella:I guess I just want to share something with people that I couldn't with regular words.
Quella:And most of all, I want to leave something behind after I'm gone.
Quella:Even if I have to work myself ragged and go broke, having the chance to do that...it's enough, I think.
