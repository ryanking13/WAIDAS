Xu
root-1-B:You always leave good tips.  I appreciate it.
action end

action:statement:root-1-B
Darryl:Oh, no problem.  I remember when I used to be a waiter, so I can sympathize.
Darryl:It's not a job that I miss.  How are you holding up with it?
next:root-1-C
action end

action:response:root-1-C
Xu
root-1-D:It could be worse.
root-1-E:I hate every moment of it.
action end

action:statement:root-1-D
Darryl:That's true.  It certainly could be.
next:root-null
action end

action:statement:root-1-E
Darryl:Ha!  Now there's an honest answer.
Darryl:If you're truly unhappy, let that misery drive you to better places.
next:root-null
action end

action:statement:root-2
Darryl:The sun, the waves, and the fresh air.  Brings back lots of memories.
Darryl:Say, what happened to your friend from earlier?
next:root-2-A
action end

action:response:root-2-A
Xu
root-2-C:We had a bit of a fight.
root-2-D:He had to go back to work.
action end

action:statement:root-2-C
Darryl:Is that so?  Sorry to hear about that.
next:root-2-null
action end

action:statement:root-2-D
Darryl:I see.  He went back to that empty observation room.
next:root-2-E
action end

action:statement:root-2-E
Darryl:...You know, I can tell he likes you.
Darryl:But you're not so crazy about him, are you?
next:root-2-F
action end

action:response:root-2-F
Xu
root-2-G:Well, I mean...
root-2-H:I am not.
action end

action:statement:root-2-G
Darryl:It's exactly that hesitation that he will draw hope from.
Darryl:I doubt he'll ever make the first move.
Darryl:And the longer it drags on, the worse it'll get.
Darryl:You should be clear with him.
next:root-2-J
action end

action:statement:root-2-H
Darryl:Everybody wants someone who doesn't want them, eh?
next:root-null
action end

action:response:root-2-J
Xu
</>root-null:Oh, I think I took care of that...
action end


action:statement:root-3
Darryl:Oh, I'm an attorney.
next:root-3-A
action end

action:response:root-3-A
Xu
root-3-B:Oh, cool!  You like being an attorney?:trigger.chap1xuDarrylProgress.on
root-3-trigger.chap1xuDarrylProgress:If you didn't like being an attorney, why'd you become one?
root-3-C:You must make a lot, right?
</>root-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root-3-B
Darryl:Ha!  You've clearly watched too much TV.
Darryl:I don't know what you think being an attorney is like, but I can tell you there's nothing 'cool' about it.
next:root-3-A
action end

action:statement:root-3-trigger.chap1xuDarrylProgress
Darryl:I guess it was for the stability.  I thought if I had a strong career, I'd be free to do whatever I wanted.
Darryl:Travel, write...everything.
Darryl:Instead, I just became an attorney.
next:root-3-A
action end

action:statement:root-3-C
Darryl:Is that a glint in your eye?
Darryl:I guess many would consider it a lot.  I'm fortunate in that way.
Darryl:But here's the real question...is it enough?
next:root-3-A
action end



action:response:root2
Xu
root2-A:You really like it out here, don't you?
root2-B:You said you wanted to travel and write.  What's stopping you from doing that now?
</>root2-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root2-A
Darryl:I guess so.
Darryl:It's usually empty out here.  I like that.
next:root2-A-1
action end

action:response:root2-A-1
Xu
root2-A-2:You should come inside!  It's boring just staying out here all the time.
root2-A-3:Oh.  Am I bothering you?
</>root2-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root2-A-2
Darryl:...I appreciate the thought.
Darryl:But I think I'll stay out here, all the same.
next:root2-A-1
action end

action:statement:root2-A-3
Darryl:No, not really.
Darryl:Don't worry about it.
next:root2-A-1
action end

action:statement:root2-B
Darryl:I guess I could.  I have the money and time.
Darryl:I always wanted to go to Asia...South America...Africa.
Darryl:Comically enough, I no longer have the desire.
next:root2-B-1
action end

action:response:root2-B-1
Xu
root2-B-2:What do you mean?  That sounds like a great idea!
root2-B-3:Going by yourself seems kinda boring.  If you need a travel partner...
</>root2-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root2-B-2
Darryl:Yeah.  It is a good idea.
Darryl:...It just doesn't have the same appeal for me anymore.
Darryl:And anyway, I have a different kind of vacation planned.
next:root2-B-1
action end

action:statement:root2-B-3
Darryl:No, I'm okay by myself.
next:root2-B-1
action end
