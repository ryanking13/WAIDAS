Ferdinand:Hello everyone!
Ferdinand:I'm afraid I have some more dreadful news.  I don't want to cause any panic, but these things must be said.
Ferdinand:It would appear that two more people on the ship have gone missing.

Ferdinand:This morning, the ship staff and I did a comprehensive search of the ship.
Ferdinand:Donovan, the passenger from room 201, was missing.
Ferdinand:So was the passenger from room 205.  A boy named Paulo, if I remember correctly.

Quella:Oh my god...
Garv:...just like the captain.  Why is this happening?
Marcurio:We've got no idea.  But if it was unclear before what happened to the captain...I think we know now.
Garv:This changes everything.  Who will be next?  How can we be sure we are safe?

Quella:...Where's Gwen?  I don't see her anywhere.  Shouldn't she hear about this?
Alton:She...she knows...
Ferdinand:That's right.  When we were searching the ship, we found something very troubling.  Very troubling indeed.
Ferdinand:In Gwen's room we found a key.  A very particular key.
Xu:The ship's master key.  It can open any door in the entire ship.  It had gone missing from the pilothouse not long ago.
Garv:So?  What does that have to do with these recent disappearances?

Ferdinand:You can tell them, Xu.
Xu:...Right.  Okay.
Xu:Before he went missing, I talked to Donovan.  He was searching for the captain, who he believed was still on the ship.
Xu:In order to find her, he had gotten hold of the master key.  I saw it in his room.
Xu:When he disappeared, so did the key.  And then we found it...in Gwen's room.

Quella:No.  That can't be right.  I don't believe it.
Marcurio:Well, we didn't have to believe it.  We saw it ourselves.
Marcurio:It's hard to come to any other conclusion.  And honestly, I'm not too surprised.  She was kind of crazy.
Quella:...
Quella:What's happened to her?  Where is she?
Ferdinand:You can be at ease, Quella.  We have only restrained Gwen in the observation room.  I think everything is simpler that way.
Ferdinand:After we land, we can ensure that she stays on board while the proper authorities take a look at this case.
Ferdinand:This is a lot of information to take in at once, I know.  I'm truly sorry that things have reached this point.
Ferdinand:But I want everyone to know that they have no reason to feel they are in danger.  The situation has been controlled.
Ferdinand:We will reach land in a couple days.  This awful affair will be behind us before you know it.

Quella:I don't understand.  I...I can't believe Gwen could do something like that.
Garv:And maybe you shouldn't.
Quella:What do you mean?  You don't think it was her?
Garv:At first glance it might seem like Gwen having the key implicates her, maybe.
Garv:But think.  What doors does the master key open?  All of them, of course.  Including...the door to Gwen's room.
Garv:What if someone took the key from Donovan, used it to get into Gwen's room, and planted it there?
Quella:...You're right.  They could have done it overnight while she was asleep.  Anyone could have done that.
Garv:So in reality, it tells us nothing.
Garv:I think the truth is still out there.  And we have to find it.
Garv:Getting to that truth might involve clearing Gwen's name.
Garv:I have a lot to think about.  I'm sure you do as well.  Take care of yourself, and be safe.
Quella:Thank you, Garv.  I'm glad I'm not the only one here who has a little faith.
Quella:Take care of yourself too.  The real criminal must still be free.
Darryl:...

Darryl:Three people have been killed or abducted.
Darryl:No witnesses.  No crime scene.  No evidence.
Darryl:I think the truth died along with the captain.
Darryl:I think it's hopeless.

Xu:Hmm...
Xu:Given that the key Donovan had is different from the one found in Gwen's room...
Xu:Is it possible that I'm not the only one who was getting anonymous orders?
Xu:What if someone else was bribed to plant the key in Gwen's room?
Xu:But who else would it be?
