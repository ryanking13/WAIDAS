Quella:I guess...I'd have to say yesterday afternoon, maybe?
Quella:I don't think I've seen her today at all.
Quella:Then again, I basically locked myself in my room most of day.

Quella:I'm reserving judgment for now.  It doesn't help to jump to any wild conclusions.
next:root2
action end

action:statement:root2-2
Quella:Searching the ship isn't a bad idea.  Also, someone on board may know something about what happened to her.
Quella:That Donovan guy is very secretive.  I would like to know what he's thinking...

action end

action:statement:root2-3
Quella:I haven't the foggiest idea.  Given how new she was here, I doubt it would have been over something personal, though.

action:statement:root2-captain2-A
Quella:She stopped by my room some times while I was writing.  She even read through some of my drafts and gave feedback.
Quella:She sincerely wanted to help me within moments of finding out who I am.  A lot of empathy in her.
Quella:I'd like to see her again and return the favor.  She had clearly been through a lot.

Quella:Sometimes the people who seem the warmest and liveliest are the ones truly struggling.
Quella:She was very friendly, but she never talked about herself.  Where she was from, what she did before this.
Quella:I think she came here to get away from her past.  There was something she needed to forget.
next:root2-captain2
action end

action:statement:root2-captain2-B
Quella:She'd stop by the lower decks when she could to check up on people.  It was a nice gesture.
Quella:She meshes better with some people than others, but I think everyone generally likes her.

Quella:I guess everyone has decided they're...dead.
Quella:It seems so strange to decide that so quickly, but I guess there aren't many alternatives.

action:statement:root3-B
Quella:Honestly, I don't.
Quella:I don't feel she's that kind of person.  She's eccentric, and scared...but not murderous.
Quella:I refuse to think she's behind a triple homicide.  It's crazy.

action:response:root3-B1
<player>
root3-B2:Have you considered if the key was a plant?
root3-B3:Then how can her innocence be proven?
root3-B4:So you think the killer is still free?
</>root3-null:Never mind.

action:statement:root3-B2
Quella:I have, yes.  It makes a lot of sense to me.
Quella:It's almost odd that more people haven't thought about that.
next:root3-B1
action end

action:statement:root3-B3
Quella:I'm not sure.  I guess one way would be to incriminate some one else?
Quella:But that doesn't seem possible.  We know so little about the disappearance of the captain, Donovan, and Paulo...
next:root3-B1

Quella:It sounds like that to me.
Quella:I bet it would be really convenient for that person if Gwen took all the blame, don't you?

action:statement:root3-C
Quella:I don't know.
Quella:All I know is...something big is going on here.  Something larger than any of us.
Quella:Call it a feeling.  I just know.
next:root3
action end

action:statement:root3-D
Quella:I think if we want to get to the truth of things, Gwen needs to be cleared of guilt.
Quella:Then we can focus on looking for the real culprit.  Whoever that is.
