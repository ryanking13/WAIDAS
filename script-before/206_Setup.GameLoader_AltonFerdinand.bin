Ferdinand:Last night?  Why, I was making sure all of the ship's readings were correct.
Ferdinand:Double checking all of our instruments in the pilothouse.  Yes, that took a while.
Ferdinand:I got to bed rather late, I must admit, but it was worth it!

Alton
root-1-trigger.xuIsFollowing-2:Isn't that something the captain would normally do?
root-1-trigger.xuIsFollowing-3:Was all of that really necessary?
</>root-null:Um, cool.

Ferdinand:Maybe...but is it not my job, as the first mate, to assist the captain in any way I can?
Ferdinand:She cannot be everywhere at once.  So I am like an extension to her eyes and ears!
Ferdinand:That means making sure everything is in order, at all parts of the ship, all the time.

Ferdinand:It may seem unnecessary, until the day when suddenly it isn't.
Ferdinand:You never know what might go wrong, and if they do, it's better to know sooner rather than later!
Ferdinand:Yes indeed - forewarned is forearmed.  And I am always forewarned.

Ferdinand:She must have turned in for the night.  She was around a little earlier, I think.
Ferdinand:We make a great team, I think!
Ferdinand:She's a little rough around the edges with people, but I'm a natural people-person.
Ferdinand:And I may be a little fuzzy with details, but she is the paragon of diligence.
Ferdinand:When two such as us get together, what can't we accomplish?

Ferdinand:They seem quite content.
Ferdinand:But perhaps - as the ship entertainer - you are more of an authority on the matter!
Ferdinand:I'm sure you've been able to acquaint yourself with all the passengers at the observation room, yes?

root-2-A-1:I guess, if you say so?
root-2-A-2:No, not at all actually.

root-2-A-4:What are you talking about?

Ferdinand:Well, everyone has slow days.  The important thing is that you don't let them get you down!
Ferdinand:Why, whenever I run into a problem like that, you know what I do?
Ferdinand:Ignore it!
Ferdinand:Yup!
Ferdinand:And then it just goes away.  Probably.  I don't even know!  That's the beauty of it!
Ferdinand:Well, great talk, Alton!  Keep up the good work!

Ferdinand:Ooh, hmm, yes, I would, I really would.
Ferdinand:But you see, I'm busy.  So busy.  Yes, very much so.
Ferdinand:With the boat.  You know.  Looking after the boat.
Ferdinand:But really, it's for the best.  I'd just cramp your style!
