Quella
chap4-A:Don't worry, Gwen.  I'm going to try and prove you're innocent.
</>chap4-null:Goodbye.
action end

action:statement:chap4-A
Gwen:R-really?  Oh, thank you.  I think you're the only person who really believes in me.
Gwen:But what can you do?
next:chap4-B
action end

action:response:chap4-B
Quella
chap4-C:Who was there when they found the key in your room?
action end

action:statement:chap4-C
Gwen:All of the ship staff.  Ferdinand, Marcurio, Xu, and Alton.
Gwen:They apparently had been searching all of the ship together.
next:chap4-D
action end

action:response:chap4-D
Quella
chap4-E:You know, this wouldn't be the first time a key was in a place it shouldn't be...
chap4-F:Have you been able to talk to any of them?
</>chap4-null:I'll see you later.  Hang in there.
action end

action:statement:chap4-E
Gwen:What do you mean?
next:chap4-G

action:response:chap4-G
Quella
chap4-G-2:I just wonder if one of the crew members in particular knows more about the master key than they're letting on...
action end

action:statement:chap4-G-2
Gwen:I wouldn't know...do they?
next:chap4-D
action end

action:statement:chap4-F
Gwen:No, well...it's not like I can walk up to them and say hi.
Gwen:If they come in here though I can try to speak to them and pick their minds.
Gwen:I'd really like to talk to them, honestly...
next:chap4-D
action end





action:response:chap6
Quella
chap6-A:I knew you were innocent.  Restraining you was absurd.
chap6-trigger.chap2quellaGwenProgress:How are you holding up?  Is everything okay?
</>chap6-null:Talk to you later.
action end

action:statement:chap6-A
Gwen:Thank you for believing in me.
Gwen:...Marcurio knew I was innocent.  But he said the way I acted made me suspicious.
next:chap6-B
action end

action:response:chap6-B
Quella
chap6-C:Don't listen to that.  It had nothing to do with you.
chap6-D:Is that why you think you were framed?
</>chap6-null:Talk to you later.
action end

action:statement:chap6-C
Gwen:Yeah...I guess you're right.
Gwen:It sounded like he's still fighting some demons of his own.
next:chap6-B
action end

action:statement:chap6-D
Gwen:I don't know.
Gwen:Maybe...it isn't a reflection of me, but just the circumstances.
Gwen:I was just caught in the middle of something larger than myself.
next:chap6-B
action end

action:statement:chap6-trigger.chap2quellaGwenProgress
Gwen:I don't really get it.  I'm just a stranger to you...
Gwen:...Why do you seem to care so much?

action:response:chap6-2
Quella
chap6-2-A:I don't know if I have a reason.  Do I need one?:trigger.chap6quellaGwenProgress.on
chap6-trigger.chap6quellaGwenProgress:It's not strange, if that's how you've been taught to think.
action end

action:statement:chap6-2-A
Gwen:...
Gwen:I guess not.
Gwen:It never occurred to me...that someone wouldn't need a reason.
Gwen:Normally when people are nice to me, I distrust them because of that.
Gwen:Is that strange?
next:chap6-2
action end

action:statement:chap6-trigger.chap6quellaGwenProgress
Gwen:...I guess you're right.  Maybe it's something I just have to unlearn.
Gwen:There's probably a lot that I'll have to unlearn.
