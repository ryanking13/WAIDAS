<!>trigger.chap6quellaPaulosRoom:I was able to take a look at Paulo's room after he disappeared.
root-A:You're not thinking clearly, Donovan.  You know this isn't right.
root-B:What about Paulo?  Is he okay?
root-C:Don't we need to attend to these people?  We can sort everything else out later.
</>root-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root-A
Donovan:I'm thinking very clearly.
Donovan:Letting the killer go would mean way more people suffering.  You've seen what they're capable of.
Donovan:If this boat reaches land, they'll slip away.  I just know it.  This is my last chance to end this.
next:root-A-1
action end

action:response:root-A-1
Quella
root-A-2:So that means killing innocent people is okay?
root-A-3:Isn't there evidence here we can use against them?
action end

action:statement:root-A-2
Donovan:Innocent people are murdered all over the world as collateral damage of politics or war.
Donovan:In comparison, this is nothing.

Donovan:If there was, I wouldn't be talking to you right now.  I would have already ended things.
Donovan:But this place has been cleansed of anything incriminating.
Donovan:Do you think the killer even anticipated that you would all end up here?
next:root
action end

action:statement:root-B
Donovan:No.  He's not okay.
Donovan:If there was any doubt that the killer I'm after was on this boat...it's been erased now.
Donovan:Paulo's injuries match up with his previous victims.  Early stage victims, at least.
Donovan:Still, most fingers are broken, there's signs of strangulation, and other...injuries.
Donovan:He's not going to be okay for a very long time.
next:root
action end

action:statement:root-C
Donovan:We can attend to them after the killer has been dealt with.
Donovan:Before then, they won't truly be safe.

Ferdinand:You did?  But that room was off-limits!  How did you get in there?
Donovan:Shut up.
Donovan:What did you find?
next:root-paulo
action end

action:response:root-paulo
Quella
root-trigger.chap6FerdEnd1:One of his books was lying on the floor.  It had a page torn out.:trigger.chap5paulosHint.on
root-trigger.chap6FerdEnd2:I found a bracelet of Marcurio's on his dresser.  It had blood on it.
<!>root-trigger.chap5paulosPage:What if the page you found on Paulo came from the book in his room?
</>root:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root-trigger.chap6FerdEnd1
Donovan:If there was a struggle it would make sense for things to be thrown to the floor.
Donovan:But I don't think this tells us anything by itself.
next:root-paulo
action end

action:statement:root-trigger.chap5paulosPage
Donovan:That would tie the page to his abduction.
Donovan:Presumably he tore the page out of the book shortly before he was taken.
Donovan:It all seems a little too neat to be an accident.  But why?
next:root-paulosHint
action end

action:response:root-paulosHint
Quella
root-paulosHint1:Maybe it was just an accident.
root-paulosHint2:Maybe there's something special about the page he tore out.:trigger.chap5ferdNail1.on
root-paulosHint3:Did he leave a message on the page?
action end

action:statement:root-paulosHint1
Donovan:It's possible.  But then it tells us nothing, and this is useless information.
next:root-paulosHint
action end

action:statement:root-paulosHint3
Donovan:There are no writings on the page, and the text itself is completely unremarkable.
Donovan:Assuming he tore the page out deliberately, chances are he wouldn't have any time to leave such a message.
next:root-paulosHint
action end

action:statement:root-paulosHint2
Donovan:The page was torn straight off.  It does look like he deliberately took out this page.
Donovan:Why?  What was unique about this page?
Donovan:I suppose its page number.  Page 106.
Donovan:...It could be a room number.  There isn't a room 106, but there is a B-106.
Donovan:That's the first mate's room, isn't it?
Ferdinand:W-why...I suppose it is.
Ferdinand:What a strange coincidence.  Though there are many other pages in the book that could have matched with a room!
Donovan:Not that many.
Ferdinand:Well, it's truly an unfortunate fluke.
Donovan:It is circumstantial, but...suspicious.

Marcurio:Wait, we talked about that!  It wasn't what it looked like!
Donovan:You better have a really good story.  What were you doing there, Marcurio?
Marcurio:I wasn't there.  Not then, at least.
Marcurio:My bracelet was taken by that stupid cat.  It must've carried it around and dropped it in that kid's room.
Garv:He's right.  I saw Sunshine carrying it that night as she passed through my room.
Donovan:That sounds absurd.  How does a cat steal a bracelet off a grown man's arm?  And why?
Marcurio:Does it matter why?  There's testimony backing me up.
next:root-bracelet
action end

action:response:root-bracelet
Quella
root-bracelet1:The cat likes jewelry.  When he knelt down, the bracelet was in reach.
root-bracelet2:He's lying.  He gave the cat his bracelet.
root-bracelet1:The cat was on a dresser, and when he tried to move it, it fought back.
action end

action:statement:root-bracelet1
Donovan:It's possible.  Is that what happened?
Marcurio:Sure.  Does it matter?  Does it change anything?
Donovan:...I can't see how it does.
next:root-bracelet
action end

action:statement:root-bracelet2
Marcurio:That bracelet was a gift.  I've had it for years.  Why would I give it to some rodent?
next:root-bracelet3
action end

action:response:root-bracelet3
Quella
root-bracelet4:Because you needed the cat to be quiet and leave you alone.:trigger.chap5catExplanation.on
root-bracelet5:You didn't like the bracelet that much.
root-bracelet6:You wanted to use the bracelet as an alibi.
action end

action:statement:root-bracelet5
Marcurio:...I just said it was an important gift.
Marcurio:And again, even if that were true how would it change anything?
next:root-bracelet3
action end

action:statement:root-bracelet6
Marcurio:So, what...I give it to the cat, the cat drops it somewhere else, and it looks like I was there?
Marcurio:Except that actually still doesn't give me a good alibi.  It makes no sense at all.
next:root-bracelet3
action end

action:statement:root-bracelet4
Marcurio:Okay...say that were true.  I still don't see how it's relevant to everything else.
Marcurio:That guy's pointing a gun at us, and we're arguing about why a cat took my bracelet?!
Garv:It's relevant because you were in Gwen's room, weren't you?
Garv:You were planting the master key to incriminate her, as you had been instructed.
Garv:The cat was there, since it snuck through the vents...and it was in your way.  It wanted to play with you.
Garv:You needed it to move and leave you alone, but if you antagonized it, Gwen would wake up.
Garv:So you gave it something to keep it distracted.  And you planted the key in silence.
Marcurio:...Yeah.  You're right.
Marcurio:So I was planting the key in Gwen's room when it happened.  So what?
Donovan:Shut up.
Marcurio:Again, we're just going in circles...
Donovan:Shut up!
next:root-null
action end

action:statement:root-garvsHint
Donovan:Don't you idiots get it?
Donovan:The blood on the bracelet means the cat left it in Paulo's room during or after his abduction.
Donovan:Meaning, Marcurio planted the key before Paulo was taken.
Donovan:Tell me, if the master key was in Gwen's room...how could anyone break into Paulo's room?
Donovan:There should only be one other person who would be able to unlock his door.
