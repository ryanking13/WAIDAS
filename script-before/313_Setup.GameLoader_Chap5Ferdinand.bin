root-A:Donovan, please, this is madness!  As your first mate, I have to say this is very much against the ship regulations!
root-B:Did you notice anything about the person who shot you?  Strange that they got close to you and yet you don't know who they are.
</>root-C:Never mind.

Donovan:I had my back to them while they shot me.
Donovan:I tried to turn around, but I didn't see anything besides a black cloak.
Donovan:They said only a few words, in a strange unrecognizable voice.  Perhaps they knew about my hidden audio recorders...
Donovan:One of the things I thought I would find here might be the gun, or the cloak.  But no.
Donovan:They could be at the bottom of the ocean by now.
