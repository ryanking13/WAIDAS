Quella
root-1:How goes things?
root-trigger.chap4Bracelet:Hey, did you lose a bracelet recently, by any chance?
</>root-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root-1
Marcurio:Huh?
Marcurio:Oh, it's fine.  Same as always.  Work.
next:root-2
action end

action:response:root-2
Quella
root-2-A:You're always working?  But there aren't that many passengers to feed.
root-3-A:Do you like your work?
root-trigger.chap2quellaMarcProgression:Do you have any plans of getting a job somewhere else?
</>root-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root-2-A
Marcurio:There aren't, but I still have to maintain the kitchen and its stock.
Marcurio:I don't get a lot of stock.  If any goes unaccounted for, that could cause problems.
Marcurio:And if I'm not doing that, I'm probably trying new dishes out.
Marcurio:Unlike other people here, I take my work seriously.  That takes time.
next:root-2-B
action end

action:response:root-2-B
Quella
root-2-C:Sounds like we have a work-a-holic here!
</>root-null:Talk to you later.
action end

action:statement:root-2-C
Marcurio:Heh, like you're one to talk!
Marcurio:I've heard about how you hole yourself up writing all day, or something like that.
Marcurio:And besides, being able to work hard is a virtue.
Marcurio:The only surefire way to move forward is through blood, sweat and tears.
next:root-2
action end


action:statement:root-3-A
Marcurio:Wow, I can't remember the last time someone's asked me that.
Marcurio:Actually, I don't think anyone ever has asked me that.
next:root-3-B
action end

action:response:root-3-B
Quella
root-3-C:Well, I'm asking you now!:trigger.chap2quellaMarcProgression.on
</>root-3-D:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root-3-C
Marcurio:Heh, fair enough.
Marcurio:In a sense, food is my passion.  It's why I wake up in the morning.
Marcurio:But this...this is the most pathetic kitchen I've ever seen.
Marcurio:It's under-equipped, understocked, and I have virtually no customers to feed.
Marcurio:I'm stuck making the same shit, to the same five or ten people.
Marcurio:No experimentation.  No creativity.  Just the same mind-numbing repetition every day.
Marcurio:I...I really hate this place.
next:root-2
action end

action:statement:root-trigger.chap2quellaMarcProgression
Marcurio:I don't know.  For me, getting another job would be...complicated.
Marcurio:I have something on the backburner, though.  Maybe it's my way out of here.
Marcurio:Well...I don't know anymore.  Recently it seems like everything's changing.
next:root-2
action end


action:statement:root-trigger.chap4Bracelet
Marcurio:Oh, let me guess...did that little shit give it to you?  That's just great.
Marcurio:I was looking for it all...wait.  What's wrong?
next:root-chap4Clue
action end

action:response:root-chap4Clue
Quella
root-chap4Clue-A:I found a bracelet with the letter 'M' on it...in Paulo's room.  Covered in blood.
action end

action:statement:root-chap4Clue-A
Marcurio:...
Marcurio:No way...uh...
Marcurio:Just a second ago...I was talking about a different bracelet.
next:root-chap4Clue-2
action end

action:response:root-chap4Clue-2
Quella
root-chap4Clue-B:Don't lie.  It's 'M' for 'Marcurio'.  Obviously it's yours.
root-chap4Clue-C:What were you doing in Paulo's room, Marcurio?:trigger.chap4BraceletExcuse.on
<!>root-trigger.chap4BraceletExcuse:There's no way you would've left the bracelet in there during the search.  You're not telling me the truth.:trigger.chap4CatBracelet.on
root-trigger.chap4CatBracelet:What would other people think if they heard about this?
</>root-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root-chap4Clue-B
Marcurio:Alright, alright, yeah.  It's mine.  It was a gift.
Marcurio:...Shouldn't have even kept the damn thing.
next:root-chap4Clue-2
action end

action:statement:root-chap4Clue-C
Marcurio:I never went in there, I swear!  I mean, not by myself.
Marcurio:Sure, I went in with Alton, Sue and Ferdinand.  For the search.  That's when we found the kid was missing.
Marcurio:That was the only time.  I never went in that room before or after, I swear to god.
next:root-chap4Clue-2
action end

action:statement:root-trigger.chap4BraceletExcuse
Marcurio:No, I didn't leave the bracelet in during the search.  I barely entered the room.
Marcurio:But I never went in at any other time either.  Look...it was that stupid cat.
Marcurio:I ran into it last night, and it started attacking me!  It went completely nuts!
Marcurio:I was caught off guard, and when I reacted, the bracelet kinda flew off.
Marcurio:The cat must've nabbed it and carried it around for a while.  I just assumed it gave it to you, like a gift or something.
Marcurio:I had no idea it would put it in Paulo's room, of all places.
next:root-chap4Clue-2
action end

action:statement:root-trigger.chap4CatBracelet
Marcurio:Hey, hold up.  Look, you have to...wait a sec.
Marcurio:How did you get into that room anyway?  Wasn't it supposed to be sealed off to passengers?
next:root-backpedal
action end

action:response:root-backpedal
Quella
root-backpedal-A:Does it matter?  There was even blood on your bracelet!
root-backpedal-B:Well...the door was unlocked...
action end

action:statement:root-backpedal-A
Marcurio:It kinda matters, considering you weren't supposed to be there in the first place.
Marcurio:When we did a search of the ship, there were multiple people so we could all back up what we saw.
Marcurio:You went in there by yourself, and coulda tampered with things without anyone knowing.
next:root-backpedal
action end

action:statement:root-backpedal-B
Marcurio:So you're saying you broke in.  And no one can back you up.
Marcurio:Look, I never set foot in there besides the search, and I sure never left anything of mine in there.
Marcurio:...I wonder if anyone saw the cat moving around with my bracelet.  That'd validate my story.
Marcurio:Maybe it would try and give it to its owner as a gift or something.
next:root-null
