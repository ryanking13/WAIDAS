Gwen:Yes, absolutely.  Aside from what I found in Donovan's room...
Gwen:Alton and Sue were wandering around together, asking what people were doing the night before.
Gwen:And there's one passenger that never comes out of his room.  He doesn't open his door for anything.

action:statement:root-3-A
Gwen:I think I heard something about...someone breaking into Sue's room.
Gwen:Maybe they were trying to find out who it could be.
Gwen:On such a small ship, someone would have to be really desperate to attempt a break in.

Gwen:Maybe this is the person stalking me.  I don't know.
