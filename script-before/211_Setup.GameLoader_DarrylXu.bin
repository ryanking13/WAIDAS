Darryl
root-2-A:Any plans on further education?
root-2-B:I used to be the exact same.
root-2-null:I should be going.
action end

action:statement:root-2-A
Xu:Well, that requires money, or loans, or grants...
Xu:All of which are far out of my reach.
Xu:I had a good shot once, but I completely blew it.  I guess I'm paying pennance.

Darryl
root-foundOut-4:Give me a good reason not to tell everyone else what you're doing.:trigger.chap3darrylXuProgress.on
root-trigger.chap3darrylXuProgress:That's not a good reason.  You get room and board, so you don't need the money.
action end

action:statement:root-foundOut-4
Xu:W-What?!
Xu:Jeez, look, I just...need any extra money I can get.

Xu:...
Xu:I'm not legal, alright?
Xu:I came over on a student visa for university, and, well...I flunked.
Xu:My family threw everything away to send me over here.  I couldn't go back like a total failure.
Xu:So, I disappeared.  Stupid, I know.  With no paperwork or money, I couldn't get very far.
Xu:This job didn't need any ID or qualifications, but I'm pretty much broke and stuck here.
Xu:For me to have any chance of getting out, I have to scrape together something.
Xu:...If I lose this job, I have no idea what'll happen to me.

root2-B:You can't keep running forever.  You know that.
</>root2-null:Bye.
action end

action:statement:root2-A
Xu:I can be a good student if I try, yeah.  It's how I got the visa in the first place.
Xu:As for why I dropped out...bad decisions.  A lot of them, all at once.
Xu:I just assumed I could pull my act together in time.  Turns out I couldn't.

action:statement:root2-B
Xu:If I go back, there's a good chance I never leave China again.
Xu:The thought of returning home feels like diving into quicksand.
Xu:Never being able to leave...I'd rather stay here.  That says a lot, doesn't it?
