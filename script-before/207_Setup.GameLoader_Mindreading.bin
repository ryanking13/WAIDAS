PLEASE

IT HURTS
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
end thoughts

ThoughtsInit:PauloIntro
HEY
    Looks like you got<n>your head handed to you.
     But this is<n>no time to be dead.
Your story doesn't<n>have to end here.
Just follow my voice...
end thoughts


ThoughtsInit:Interlude
   You've learned a great deal<n>about the other passengers on the ship.
With each person you gain control of<n>   you edge closer to the truth.
Each thread you uncover<n>ultimately has its roots in your murder.
But there is something else...
  Perhaps this mystery is not<n>as straightforward as I once thought.
There's a twist coming up.<n>  It isn't a good one.
  I have the feeling that<n>this is all going to end horribly.
I'm...scared.
Please...help me...
end thoughts



ThoughtsInit:Paulo
Another lost one
I wonder who it is
Can it help me?
So much pain
This one is different
I need your help
I am calling out to you
Please come back
It does not have to end this way
We can still change things
I can feel others below
There is something wrong here
Something dark is coming
I can't stop it myself
Come back
end thoughts





ThoughtsInit:Paulo2
I have a very bad feeling about this
What does it mean
There's something different about this time
Mom
Dad
I'm scared
I wish I was normal
So much blood
I should be safe here
Maybe this spirit can help us
end thoughts

ThoughtsInit:Paulo3
It's getting closer
I don't understand what's happening
She'll protect me
We can figure this out
Mom
Dad
I'm scared
Bodies everywhere
Why do I see so many bodies
Below us
Things are going to be okay

ThoughtsInit:Alton2
I can't believe her
She's a thief
She was stealing from me this whole time
I really like her
I hate her
This is so pathetic
Taking this job was a mistake
I'm just bothering everyone
I thought it would be different this time
end thoughts

ThoughtsInit:Alton3
I don't believe this
The captain must be somewhere
What's going on
What did Donovan steal from Xu?
She's a thief
Why do I even like her
Taking this job was a mistake
I thought it would be different this time
end thoughts

ThoughtsInit:Alton4
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
Why did Gwen have the captain's key?
Did Sue steal the captain's key at first?  Why?
They can't all be dead
Why is this happening
Stay calm
Stay calm
I never should have come here
This is going to end horribly
end thoughts





ThoughtsInit:Xu2
How did he know I had the key?
Are they going to find out?  Will I have to go home?
Why did they order me to steal that
I had no choice
I need the money
Where's the captain?
I have a bad feeling about this
He doesn't know anything about me
These people have no idea what we have to go through
end thoughts

ThoughtsInit:Xu3
This is getting out of control
What does the master key have to do with all of this
Something happened
What do I do now?
If they find out I'll have to go home
What is Donovan trying to do
This is dangerous
How can I get Donovan to talk?
end thoughts

ThoughtsInit:Xu32
This is getting out of control
Something happened
What do I do now?
This is dangerous
Should I have told him?
Is he right?  A serial killer...here?
It isn't adding up
Something else is going on
end thoughts

ThoughtsInit:Xu4
This is getting out of control
Everyone's disappearing
Donovan was wrong
I should have told him everything
The keys weren't the same
It's a lie, Gwen's key wasn't the same
I need to tell someone
Who can I trust?
end thoughts



ThoughtsInit:Marcurio2
Fuck this place
This is the last time
With the money<n>I'll be able to leave
It's worth it
Remember why
end thoughts

ThoughtsInit:Marcurio3
She got herself killed
Keep your head down
Get through this
Do your job
Protect the cargo
With the money<n>I'll be able to leave
Remember why
end thoughts

ThoughtsInit:Marcurio4
She'll be released<n>when we dock
Just swallow the lie
Do your job
Protect the cargo
Mind your own business
Remember why
end thoughts


ThoughtsInit:Donovan2
Scum of the earth
I will destroy you
I will slaughter you
I will exterminate you
You made a terrible mistake
I'll kill them all if I have to
You can't hide this time
The truth is here, and I will find it
You're trapped this time
There's no way out
end thoughts



ThoughtsInit:Garv2
None of this would be happening if not for those idiots
That idiot is ruining everything
I'll pay him back some day
Is professionalism a thing of the past?
I'm getting too old for this business
They took everything from me
Can't trust anyone
What a joke
I'm surrounded by fools
end thoughts

ThoughtsInit:Garv3
This is getting too complicated
None of this would be happening if not for those idiots
Can't trust anyone
I'm surrounded by fools
They took everything from me
Everyone here is a liar
Does he think I'll take this lying down
What a joke
end thoughts

ThoughtsInit:Garv4
I can use this
He's going to regret all of this
We can't stay here
Gwen needs to be proven innocent
Quella could be a useful ally
Those cameras nearly ruined everything
Those cameras nearly ruined everything
I have to play it safe
Things only get worse from here
Everyone here is a liar
They took everything from me
end thoughts



ThoughtsInit:Ferdinand2

It's my fault
It's my fault
It's my fault
She's gone
Why

Why bother
end thoughts

ThoughtsInit:Darryl3
It's my fault
It's my fault
It's my fault
Worthless
Pathetic
It'll be over soon

ThoughtsInit:Darryl4
It's my fault
Worthless

I can't help
It'll be over soon

It's hopeless
This place is horrible
Why

ThoughtsInit:Quella2
Can I finish it in time?
Just keep writing
Keep writing
Too late to turn back now
I'm running out of time
I need to finish this faster
Does this work even matter
None of this is any good
end thoughts

ThoughtsInit:Quella3
I want to help
Something is wrong with him
Everyone here is in pain
It's going to be okay
Just keep writing
Keep writing
Too late to turn back now
I'm running out of time
It'll be worth it
end thoughts

ThoughtsInit:Quella4
It couldn't be her
Who is doing this
We need to work together
No one is telling the truth
I want to help
Everyone here is in pain
It's going to be okay
Just keep writing
Keep writing
I'm running out of time
