root-1-B:Au contraire, this is a time when we must be optimistic!
root-1-C:There is no point in upsetting the passengers.
action end

action:statement:root-1-B
Garv:I'm not sure what there is to be optimistic about.

root-2-B:In truth, I didn't know about them beforehand.
root-2-C:They are the smallest problem I have at the moment.
action end

action:statement:root-2-B

Garv:When the captain found out, it looked as if she was ready to throw me over board!

action:statement:root-2-C
Garv:You're certainly right about that...
