Darryl
root-1:How'd you end up on this ship?
root-trigger.chap3darrylGarvProgress:You sound very bitter.
</>root-null:See you later.
action end

action:statement:root-1
Garv:I just kind of float around depending on where I'm needed for work.
Garv:Beyond that, who can say anymore?
next:root-2
action end

action:response:root-2
Darryl
root-A:That's how I've felt for a while now.
<!>root-B:There's nothing waiting back home for you?
</>root-null:I should be going.
action end

action:statement:root-A
Garv:It just comes with age.  After a while, you just realise there's no right or wrong way.
Garv:No matter how good or bad things get, life keeps moving forward.
Garv:The only thing that matters is whether you keep moving with it or not.

Darryl
root-A-2:Sounds like you've seen your fair share of ups and downs.
root-A-3:You don't think there's a right way to live?
root-B:There's nothing waiting back home for you?
</>root-null:I'll talk to you later.
action end

action:statement:root-A-2
Garv:Yeah, I've hit rock bottom more than once.  I've even lied down and slept on it.
Garv:But overall I guess I've been able to live a very comfortable life.
Garv:Point is, I always thought I had some idea where I was going, like things were all according to plan.
Garv:In truth, I had no idea.

action end

action:statement:root-A-3
Garv:Maybe that sounds crazy.  People are obsessed with self-improvement.
Garv:Generally I think you'll wind up in the same place no matter what.
Garv:We all get the life we secretly deserve.
next:root-A-1
action end

action:statement:root-B
Garv:Oh sure, sure.  Though I spend more time with my pets than my own kids.  Funny how that works out.
Garv:What about you?  You got a wife?  Kids?
next:root-B-1
action end

action:response:root-B-1
Darryl
root-B-2:An ex-wife.
action end

action:statement:root-B-2
Garv:Same here.  Let me tell you, divorce is one hell of a thing.
Garv:No matter how close you get to someone, you can never really know them completely.
Garv:There will always be some wall.  Something deep inside them you don't know about.
Garv:And sometimes that thing can just rip you to shreds.
next:root-B-3
action end

action:response:root-B-3
Darryl
root-B-4:I think I know what you mean.:trigger.chap3GarvUnlocked.on
action end

action:statement:root-B-4
Garv:Well, I'm truly sorry to hear that.
Garv:Sometimes it feels like the only things I can trust are my pets.
Garv:Sure, they're dumb as bricks, but that's how you know you can trust 'em.  I guess that's why I like animals.
Garv:...In any case, thanks for listening to the ramblings of a jaded old man.
Garv:I'll see you around.
next:root-null
action end

action:statement:root-trigger.chap3darrylGarvProgress
Garv:Trust me, you don't know the half of it.
Garv:I've seen so much by this point...people are capable of truly horrible things.
Garv:People.  We pretend we're something more, but we're just animals.
next:root-C
action end

action:response:root-C
Darryl
root-C-1:Is that what you really think?
root-C-2:That's a terrible outlook.
</>root-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root-C-1
Garv:...Maybe not.  I'm just exaggerating to be dramatic.
Garv:Don't mind the ramblings of an old man.
next:root-C
action end

action:statement:root-C-2
Garv:...Perhaps.
Garv:You haven't seen what I have.
