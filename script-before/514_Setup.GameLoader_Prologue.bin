Paulo:Nothing, huh?
Paulo:Well, I have some bad news.
Paulo:You're dead.
Paulo:In fact, you were murdered.
Paulo:But, your soul hung on to this world.  And before it faded away completely, I brought it back.
Paulo:It was actually really close...I almost failed.

Paulo:You're on a small cruise ship.  At least, that's what they call it.
Paulo:It's really more of a ferry.  A bad one.
Paulo:We're out to sea right now, so I don't know our exact location.

action end

action:statement:root-1-A-2-B-3-who
Paulo:I don't know.
Paulo:But...it shouldn't be too hard to find out.
Paulo:If you see a dead body anywhere, it's probably you.

action:statement:root-1-A-2-B-3-you
Paulo:My name's Paulo.
Paulo:I see dead people.
Paulo:It's not something I understand well...
next:root-questions2
action end

action:statement:root-1-A-2-B-3-why
Paulo:That is the big question, isn't it?
Paulo:But I don't know.  Your memories are gone, and I can't bring them back.
Paulo:I was able to pick up your final thoughts.  Pain, shock, confusion...it wasn't a quick death.
Paulo:I wish I could help more.  I'm sorry.
next:root-questions2
action end

action:statement:root-1-A-2-B-3-what
Paulo:Well, to be honest...I need your help.
Paulo:Something bad is going to happen here.  To the people on this ship.  I can sense it.
Paulo:I don't know how, but we're heading into a living nightmare.
Paulo:I can't prevent it from happening myself. I'm just a kid, and the other adults won't listen to me.

root-1-A-2-B-3-what-how-C:What can I do?
action end

action:statement:root-1-A-2-B-3-what-how-C
Paulo:In your current form?  Not much.
Paulo:The fact is, you're hanging onto this world by a thread.
Paulo:Not having a body has its perks, though.
Paulo:You might be able to get inside people.  Read their minds, take control of them.
Paulo:If you can use other people to investigate, you might be able to figure out who killed you, and why.

action end

action:statement:root-1-A-2-B-3-what-how-C-4-D
Paulo:...Maybe.  But don't get too excited.  Your presence here is very weak.
Paulo:If you tried to jump into a person's body unprepared, their own consciousness could consume you.
Paulo:If you understood that person's thoughts and feelings, you'd stand a better shot at jumping into them.
Paulo:So, the more people you understand, the more you'll be able to control.

Paulo:From what I've seen, it comes in two degrees.  You'll find most people won't give up full autonomy right away.
Paulo:But if you understand a person at a basic level, you should still be able to influence them.
Paulo:You could guide them along and nudge them to do things, but you would be sharing their body, not stealing it.
Paulo:For example, you wouldn't be able to use their voice to talk about things they have no awareness of.
Paulo:However, if you completely understand someone's will, you should be able to take full control of them.
Paulo:You could hijack their body, and speak through their voice.
Paulo:I don't expect this level of control would come easily, though.

Paulo:Oh, good timing.  You could try to take control of that cat.
Paulo:Its spirit shouldn't put up much resistance, so you should be able to take full control of it.
Paulo:Go see what happens.

Paulo:You should try and take control of the cat over there.
Paulo:Then come back and talk to me.
