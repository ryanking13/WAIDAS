<!>root-2:I, um, heard you over the intercom.
</>root-null:Never mind.

action:statement:root-2
Ferdinand:As the first mate of this fine ship, I must attend to any and all concerns of my passengers!
Ferdinand:Is there anything that concerns you?
next:root-3

action:response:root-3
Gwen
<!>root-4:I think I'm being followed.
</>root-null:No.

root-6:It's hard to explain.  But I can tell.  I can sense it.  Him.  Watching me.:trigger.chap2gwenFerdProgress.on
root-trigger.chap2gwenFerdProgress:I know how that sounds.  But you have to believe me.
action end

action:statement:root-6
Ferdinand:I see...
next:root-5
action end

action:statement:root-trigger.chap2gwenFerdProgress
Ferdinand:Please, miss.  Be at ease.  I understand.
Ferdinand:Some people, such as yourself, simply have a highly attuned...intuition.
Ferdinand:Our instincts often see danger before our eyes do.
Ferdinand:As a sailor, it is vital that I also trust my instincts.
Ferdinand:To be honest, I have felt a dark presence on this ship.  But I have kept quiet, to avoid alarming the others.
next:root-9
action end

action:response:root-9
Gwen
root-9-A:What do you mean, dark presence?:trigger.chap2gwenFerdProgress2.on
root-trigger.chap2gwenFerdProgress2:W-what are you going to do?
action end

action:statement:root-9-A
Ferdinand:I suspect that the passenger Donovan - if that is his real name - is up to no good.
Ferdinand:Yes, I sense in him a great ill will.  
Ferdinand:It is as if...he is on the ship in pursuit of someone.
next:root-9
action end

action:statement:root-trigger.chap2gwenFerdProgress2
Ferdinand:I'm not sure.  If I could only learn more, maybe I'd be able to do something...
Ferdinand:If he could be lured out of his room, there'd be an opportunity to go inside and look around.
Ferdinand:But my advice to you is to stay away from him.  He could be very dangerous.
Ferdinand:And stay away from his room B201.  You know, the one downstairs, up and to the left.
Ferdinand:And don't even think of trying to investigate him for yourself - just leave that to me!
next:root-13
action end

action:response:root-13
Gwen
root-null:Y-yes.  Of course.:trigger.gwensSearchOn.on
action end



action:statement:root2
Ferdinand:Hello again, miss.  Rest assured, I will do my utmost to ensure the ship's safety.
Ferdinand:Who knows what secrets lie in Donovan's room on the first floor...
Ferdinand:But again, I must ask that you don't do anything rash!
next:root-null

action:statement:afterSearch
Ferdinand:Hello, madame!  How are you?  I hope you are more at ease.
next:afterSearch-1

action:response:afterSearch-1
Gwen
<!>afterSearch-2:Um.  Hi.  About Donovan...
action end

action:statement:afterSearch-2
Ferdinand:Ah, yes, Donovan.  Please tell me you have stayed clear of him?
next:afterSearch-3
action end

action:response:afterSearch-3
Gwen
afterSearch-4:Actually, I, um, took a quick peek in his room...
action end

action:statement:afterSearch-4
Ferdinand:Young miss!  I expressly warned you that it was much too dangerous!
Ferdinand:And yet you still went, putting yourself in direct danger!
Ferdinand:...What did you find?
next:afterSearch-5
action end

action:response:afterSearch-5
Gwen
afterSearch-computer:I found a lot of...computer stuff?  Black boxes and wires and things.
afterSearch-cameras:There were cameras and audio recorders.  Lots of them.
afterSearch-key:I found a weird golden rod with engravings all over it.:trigger.chap2gwenFerdProgress3.on
<!>afterSearch-trigger.chap2gwenFerdProgress3:Do you think he's following me?  What can we do?:trigger.chapterTwoClose.on
action end

action:statement:afterSearch-computer
Ferdinand:Perhaps he is a hacker!  Using technology to steal everyone's information.
Ferdinand:This is very suspicious.  And good to know.
next:afterSearch-5
action end

action:statement:afterSearch-cameras
Ferdinand:A voyeur, in my ship?  What does he want to see with all of these cameras?
Ferdinand:I don't like it.  Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
next:afterSearch-5
action end

action:statement:afterSearch-key
Ferdinand:An engraved golden rod?  That must be the...
Ferdinand:...
Ferdinand:Thank you for your aid, miss.
Ferdinand:I am now more sure than ever that this man is up to no good.
next:afterSearch-5
action end


action:statement:afterSearch-trigger.chap2gwenFerdProgress3
Ferdinand:Well...to be honest, Gwen, I think it might be worse than that.
Ferdinand:Between you and me...the captain hasn't been around recently.  I haven't been able to find her.
next:afterSearch-null
action end

action:statement:afterSearch2
Ferdinand:I am beginning to fear the worst.
Ferdinand:But don't worry - I have a plan that will sort all of this out.
Ferdinand:In the meantime, please keep our little discovery just between the two of us.
Ferdinand:Above all, do not trust anyone else aboard the ship.  Especially not Donovan.  Can you do this?
next:afterSearch-10
action end

action:response:afterSearch-10
Gwen
<!!>afterSearch-10-A:I don't like this at all.  Shouldn't the others know about the captain?:trigger.epilogueGF3.on
<!!>afterSearch-10-B:I still don't understand what's going on with Donovan.:trigger.epilogueGF2.on
<!!>afterSearch-10-C:Okay...I trust you.:trigger.epilogueGF1.on
action end

action:statement:afterSearch-10-A
Ferdinand:I want nothing more than to tell the others, and yet...
Ferdinand:I worry that there is someone behind the captain's sudden absence.
Ferdinand:If I spread this bad news, such a person might become spooked and cover their tracks.
Ferdinand:I need time to carry out an investigation.  Until then we must be discrete.
next:root-null
action end

action:statement:afterSearch-10-B
Ferdinand:It's...a bit difficult to explain.
Ferdinand:I can only tell you this - you mentioned seeing something in Donovan's room.
Ferdinand:It is not a thing that Donovan should have.
Ferdinand:Indeed, I fear what he means to do with it.
next:root-null
action end

action:statement:afterSearch-10-C
Ferdinand:Very good, miss.  I appreciate your cooperation.
Ferdinand:In the future, though, I beg that you stay out of harm's way.
Ferdinand:I would be most remiss if misfortune befell you because of your actions.
next:root-null
action end



action:statement:afterChapTwo
Ferdinand:Please be careful, Gwen.  And remember what I told you.
Ferdinand:We don't even know if the person following you is working alone.

chap4-A:Please...listen to me.
</>chap4-null:Say nothing
action end

action:statement:chap4-A
Ferdinand:Why hello there, Gwen.
Ferdinand:It truly grieves me to meet with you in this way.
Ferdinand:Yet such is the grim situation we find ourselves in.
next:chap4-B
action end

action:response:chap4-B
Gwen
chap4-C:You have to believe me.  I didn't do it.
chap4-D:I never saw that key before in my life.
chap4-E:The real killer must still be out there...
</>chap4-null:...Never mind.
action end

action:statement:chap4-C
Ferdinand:Would that I could believe you, miss.  I am by nature a trusting soul.
Ferdinand:But the facts of the matter would speak otherwise.
Ferdinand:In addition, your previous curiosity and suspicion of Donovan makes complete sense now.
next:chap4-C-1
action end

action:response:chap4-C-1
Gwen
chap4-C-2:But...but it was you that was suspicious of Donovan, not me!
action end

action:statement:chap4-C-2
Ferdinand:You must be mistaken, miss.  I don't recall saying anything to that effect.
Ferdinand:I do recall, however, how you managed to break into his room.
next:chap4-B
action end

action:statement:chap4-D
Ferdinand:Hmm, yes, I would certainly be willing to believe you on that count.
Ferdinand:Except, you see, the thing is, the key was in your room.
Ferdinand:So you kinda probably did see the key.  Because you took it.  And put it there.
next:chap4-B
action end

action:statement:chap4-E
Ferdinand:I imagine if we tied anyone up here, they would say much the same thing.
Ferdinand:And yet, one of them would have to be lying, wouldn't you agree?
Ferdinand:It displeases me to say so, miss, but I believe you are lying.

action:statement:chap5
Ferdinand:Oh, hello miss.
Ferdinand:How are you doing now?  I hope you are feeling okay?
Ferdinand:Have I, er, mentioned how sorry I am for tying you up in the observation room and calling you a murderer?
Ferdinand:If not, well...
Ferdinand:I'm sorry for tying you up in the observation room and calling you a murderer.
next:chap5-2
action end

action:response:chap5-2
Gwen
chap5-trigger.ending2GwenSuspicion:I had told you what I saw in Donovan's room.
chap5-A:Why did you release me, again?
chap5-B:So, who is the murderer then?
</>chap5-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:chap5-A
Ferdinand:As it turns out, one of the staff planted the key in your room.  Right under my nose!
Ferdinand:The reasons for doing so?  Even worse...bribery!  Right under my nose!
Ferdinand:You can only imagine how embarassed I am for this to have occurred right under my supervision.
next:chap5-2
action end

action:statement:chap5-B
Ferdinand:Well...actually I have no idea.
Ferdinand:No, wait, that's not true!  I'm reasonably sure it wasn't you.  So hey, process of elimination and all of that.
next:chap5-2
action end

action:statement:chap5-trigger.ending2GwenSuspicion
Ferdinand:Oh, yes, you did...although, I did tell you specifically to avoid Donovan altogether.  Hmm.
next:chap5-pressure
action end

action:response:chap5-pressure
Gwen
chap5-pressure-A:You did also tell me what room Donovan was in and repeatedly mention how suspicious he was.
chap5-pressure-B:I also told you about the master key in his room.
action end

action:statement:chap5-pressure-A
Ferdinand:Yes - all to ensure that you didn't do anything reckless, like snoop around him or his room!
Ferdinand:It isn't my fault if you did all the opposite things that I recommended, is it?
next:chap5-pressure
action end

action:statement:chap5-pressure-B
Ferdinand:Really?  I...don't quite recall that.  Cameras...servers...it's all a little fuzzy.
next:chap5-pressure2
action end

action:response:chap5-pressure2
Gwen
chap5-pressure2-A:I told you about a strange rod with a skull design.  That was the master key.  As the first mate, you must have known.
chap5-pressure2-B:I wonder how Donovan would react if I told him you also knew he had the master key.:trigger.chap6FerdClue3.on
action end

action:statement:chap5-pressure2-A
Ferdinand:Oh, in that case, I suppose so.  I'll admit I wasn't paying much attention, there was so much going on at the time...
Ferdinand:If I realized at that time, I may have wondered why and how he got it!  Don't you think?
