Gwen
root-1:Where are you from?
root-2:Where are you going?
</>root-null:Never mind.

action:statement:root-1
Garv:Well, I don't really know actually.
Garv:I travel around a lot from place to place.
Garv:I have a couple of kids, an ex-wife and lots of regrets out in Ontario.
Garv:I guess that qualifies the most.

Garv:Why, where the ship is going.  Isn't that where we're all going?

root-2-B:I guess I mean, why are you on the ship?:trigger.gwenAskedGarv.on
root-2-C:In the long-term where are you going?
root-trigger.gwenAskedGarv:Why was the warehouse closed down?:trigger.chap2gwenGarvProgression.on
root-trigger.chap2gwenGarvProgression:You don't sound very sad over the loss of two lives.
</>root-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root-2-B
Garv:Oh.  I'm heading over to a new warehouse that my company's starting to use.
Garv:One of our biggest warehouses got closed down not too long ago, actually.
Garv:So business has been bad recently.  If we don't get back to working order heads are gonna roll.
next:root-2-A
action end

action:statement:root-2-C
Garv:The long term?  Retirement, I guess.
Garv:When you're young, it seems like everything needs to have a plan.
Garv:Do this, then do this, then do this.  Very linear.
Garv:I'm just fine riding this wave out wherever it takes me now.
Garv:Clock in, clock out.

Garv:From what I heard, a couple of work-place accidents.
Garv:Two bozos got themselves killed on the job, and it just made us look bad.
Garv:We had to drop the place on account of regulations or some nonsense.
Garv:What a mess.

Garv:People die all over the world, all the time.
Garv:I didn't know these two people, so I don't have any attachment to them.  Simple as that.
Garv:Bottom line is they hurt business.  I don't have any sympathy for 'em.

chap4-A:Please...listen to me.
</>chap4-null:Say nothing

action:statement:chap4-A
Garv:Of course.
next:chap4-B

action:response:chap4-B
Gwen
chap4-C:You have to believe me.  I didn't do it.
chap4-D:I never saw that key before in my life.
chap4-E:The real killer must still be out there...
</>chap4-null:...Never mind.
action end

action:statement:chap4-C
Garv:I believe you, Gwen.  The problem is, I believe I'm in the minority.
Garv:I have to admit, if you are being framed, it is very deliberate.  You make the best scapegoat of us all.
next:chap4-C-1
action end

action:response:chap4-C-1
Gwen
chap4-C-2:E-excuse me...?
action end

action:statement:chap4-C-2
Garv:Quiet, nervous, paranoid, defensive.  No strong relation with any passengers, and hints of a troubled past.
Garv:Unable to truly advocate for herself and easily overwhelmed by circumstance.
Garv:Gwen, you are the perfect mark.
next:chap4-B
action end

action:statement:chap4-D
Garv:It most likely was a plant, then.
Garv:There must have been someone to carry that out, then.  Most likely a crew member.
Garv:I'd tell you to interrogate them, but...you may have to wait for them to come to you.
next:chap4-B
action end

action:statement:chap4-E
Garv:That is my feeling as well.  Perhaps if we can clear your name we can focus on the larger questions.
Garv:I wonder what significance the key which was planted in your room holds.
Garv:Given that such a key could only be possessed by a crew-member of some status...I feel it narrows things down quite sharply.

Gwen-Garv

action:response:chap5
Gwen
chap5-A:The killer is still around.  And they tried to frame me.
chap5-B:Do you have any idea where to look for evidence?
</>chap5-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:chap5-A
Garv:Yes, though thankfully they were not successful.
Garv:I suppose the plan was to slip away once the boat landed, while everyone was focused on you.
Garv:Their options will be much more limited now.
next:chap5
action end

action:statement:chap5-B
Garv:I'm not sure.
Garv:The staff may not be very trustworthy, but if there was concrete evidence...I think they would've found it.
Garv:But there may still be circumstantial evidence.
next:chap5-B-2
action end

action:response:chap5-B-2
Gwen
chap5-B-3:How can there be no concrete evidence?
chap5-B-4:What do you mean by circumstantial evidence?
</>chap5-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:chap5-B-3
Garv:How do criminals often dispose of evidence?  Throw it into the river.
Garv:As it just so happens, we are completely surrounded by ocean.
Garv:It would be trivial to throw away any item that could be traced back to the culprit.
next:chap5-B-2
action end

action:statement:chap5-B-4
Garv:Evidence based off of circumstance, rather than material properties.
Garv:For example...I hear that Donovan took the master key because he was looking for the captain.
Garv:If he was targeted because of this...anyone who had prior knowledge of these facts would be suspect.
Garv:I wonder, who might have known Donovan was looking for the captain before he disappeared?
