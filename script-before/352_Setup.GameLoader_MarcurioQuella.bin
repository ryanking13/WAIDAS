Marcurio-Quella

action:response:root
Marcurio
root-1:Don't see you around very often.
root-2:What do you make of this whole mess?
</>root-null:See you around.
action end

action:statement:root-1
Quella:Yeah, I guess not.
Quella:I spend a lot of my time in my room, writing for my book.
Quella:My work doesn't really allow for much socializing, unfortunately.
next:root-1-A
action end

action:response:root-1-A
Marcurio
root-1-B:Writing a book?  That takes a lot of discipline.  I'm impressed.
root-1-C:You ever sold a book before, or is this your first shot?
</>root-null:See ya.
action end

action:statement:root-1-B
Quella:Ha, thanks!  Though I'm not sure about that.
Quella:I think anyone can write a book.  Or part of one, anyway.
Quella:What takes discipline is actually finishing it!
Quella:Wait until I've actually published the book before you praise me.
next:root-1-A
action end

action:statement:root-1-C
Quella:My first time.  So yeah, it's kinda amateur hour.  I'm learning things as they go.
Quella:I know the odds are against it actually turning a profit, but I'm not so interested in that.
Quella:I really just wanna leave something behind, you know?  Before I'm rotting in the ground and all.
next:root-1-D
action end

action:response:root-1-D
Marcurio
root-1-E:Most people here are just sorta wandering around.  You have actual ambition.  I respect that.
root-1-F:Kind of a morbid way to put it.
</>root-null:Talk to you later.
action end

action:statement:root-1-E
Quella:Thanks.  Sometimes I have my doubts if it's worth it, so it feels good to hear that.
Quella:Though I wouldn't discount some of the other people here too quickly.
Quella:Everyone has their own path.  Some people find their calling sooner than others, that's all.
next:root-1-D
action end

action:statement:root-1-F
Quella:I'm not the one that's morbid.  Life is morbid.
Quella:I don't think there's anything wrong with talking about death.  We should talk about it more!
Quella:It's natural, and what's more, it happens all the time.
next:root-1-D
action end

action:statement:root-2
Quella:You mean...the captain's disappearance?
Quella:I don't know.  I'm no detective.  But...
Quella:Things don't seem right here.  More than the captain's disappearance, everything is a bit...off.
next:root-2-A
action end

action:response:root-2-A
Marcurio
root-2-B:Got any theories you'd like to share?
root-2-C:You seem to like chatting up the passengers a lot.
</>root-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root-2-B
Quella:Theories...?  I don't know.
Quella:I wonder if somebody knew the captain before they boarded the ship.
Quella:But wouldn't she have known them?  Maybe it was someone...in disguise?
Quella:...That sounds stupid.  I don't know what I'm talking about.
next:root-3
action end

action:response:root-3
Marcurio
root-3-A:It doesn't sound completely implausible.
root-3-B:There isn't any evidence for that.
action end

action:statement:root-3-A
Quella:You think so?  Hmm.
Quella:Assuming that were the case for a second, it'd mean someone here has a fake identity.
Quella:The police could figure out who's real and who isn't...but they aren't here.
Quella:So I don't know what to do with that theory anyway.
next:root-2-A
action end

action:statement:root-3-B
Quella:Yeah, you're right.  In fact, I don't think there's any evidence for anything.
Quella:She disappeared overnight without any trace whatsoever.  Where can you go with that?
next:root-2-A
action end

action:statement:root-2-C
Quella:Despite my shut-in behavior, I'm really a people person.
Quella:I like learning about people and what makes them tick.  Even the bad ones.
next:root-4
action end

action:response:root-4
Marcurio
root-4-A:I see.  Just make sure that curiosity doesn't get you in trouble.
root-4-B:I think people are boring idiots.  Most people, at least.
</>root-null:Talk to you later.
action end

action:statement:root-4-A
Quella:...What's that supposed to mean?
next:root-4-C
action end

action:response:root-4-C
Marcurio
root-4:It means take care of yourself.  That's all.
action end

action:statement:root-4-B
Quella:I'm not going to argue with you about the 'idiots' part, I suppose.  In some cases.
Quella:But everyone has a rhyme and reason.  A deeper motivation.  Even if it's not one you share or agree with.
Quella:Finding out what that is never gets boring for me.
next:root-4-D
action end

action:response:root-4-D
Marcurio
root-4-E:That's exactly the kind of hobby that can get people hurt.
action end

action:statement:root-4-E
Quella:....
