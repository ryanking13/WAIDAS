Quella
root-1:You have some really cute pets!
root-2:How is life?
root-trigger.divorce:You don't see your children?
root-trigger.ChapterFourOn:Do you think there's anything we can do to find the killer?
<!>root-trigger.chap4CatBracelet:Did you see your cat last night?
</>root-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root-1
Garv:Why thank you!  I do my best to make sure they're healthy and well behaved.
Garv:They weren't mine to begin with, so it seems only right.
next:root-1-A
action end

action:response:root-1-A
Quella
root-1-B:They weren't yours?  Whose were they?:trigger.divorce.on
</>root-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root-1-B
Garv:Oh, they were initially gifts for my two daughters.
Garv:Long story short, after the divorce I ended up keeping them.
Garv:I never thought I'd be spending more time with them than my own children!
Garv:But that's life for you.
next:root
action end


action:statement:root-2
Garv:Life is fine.  Life is always fine.  It's tougher than any of us.
Garv:As for myself, I can't complain.
next:root
action end


action:statement:root-trigger.divorce
Garv:Oh, I see them.  As a matter of fact I'm traveling back from my visitation.
Garv:It's not so bad.  There is such a thing as spending too much time with your children.
Garv:Let's just say it's a bit more taxing than raising a cat and a parakeet!
Garv:Now divorce, on the other hand, is a nasty business.  Brings out the worst in people.
Garv:You want to see what someone is truly capable of?  That's where to look.
next:root
action end



action:statement:root-trigger.ChapterFourOn
Garv:I don't know.  I'm not exactly a private eye...
Garv:But you'd think that between the captain, Donovan, and Paulo, they'd have slipped up somewhere, at least.
Garv:In addition, there's the matter of Gwen.  If she really is being framed, maybe there's something there.
next:root-chap4Clues
action end

action:response:root-chap4Clues
Quella
<!>root-chap4Clues-A:Where would I look for clues about Donovan or Paulo?:trigger.chap4Infiltrate.on
root-trigger.chap4Infiltrate:How could someone get into Paulo's room?
root-chap4Clues-B:Where would I look to prove Gwen is innocent?
</>root-chap4Clues-C:Thanks for the help.
action end

action:statement:root-chap4Clues-A
Garv:Well, the staff said they searched everyone's rooms already.  But, well...
Garv:I don't think it'd hurt to take a second look at Paulo's room.
Garv:Everyone says he always stayed in his room.  Odds are, it's the scene of a crime.
Garv:I already asked the first mate to let me in, but he said he wanted it closed down.  Afraid people might tamper with evidence.
Garv:If someone could get in there though...I wonder what they'd find?
next:root-chap4Clues
action end

action:statement:root-trigger.chap4Infiltrate
Garv:As far as I can tell, only Ferdinand has a way in.  And he's not going to share it.
Garv:I don't know how this would help, but my cat has a way of sneaking into any room she wants.
next:root-chap4Clues
action end

action:statement:root-chap4Clues-B
Garv:If the key was planted in her room, that clears her.  Simple as that.
Garv:Now if it was planted, that seems to point towards one of the staff members.
Garv:Only they knew where they would search, so they could be sure the plant was found.
Garv:Do you know any of the staff members that might be capable of pulling off something like that?
next:root-chap4Clues
action end

action:statement:root-chap4Clues-C
Garv:Hey, we're all in this together, right?
next:root-null
action end


action:statement:root-trigger.chap4CatBracelet
Garv:Well, sure.  She comes in and out of my room all the time.
next:root-chap4Bracelet
action end

action:response:root-chap4Bracelet
Quella
root-chap4Bracelet-A:Did she have anything with her - like a bracelet?:trigger.chap4FerdClue2.on
root-trigger.chap4FerdClue2-2:Where did she come from, and where did she go?
root-trigger.chap4FerdClue2-3:Did the bracelet...have any blood on it?
root-trigger.chap4FerdClue2-4:I found the bracelet she was carrying in Paulo's room.
action end

action:statement:root-chap4Bracelet-A
Garv:Yeah, actually, she did come back with some kind of jewelry last night.
Garv:I assume she stole it out of one of the passenger's rooms.  I tried to take it back from her, but she got away from me.
next:root-chap4Bracelet
action end

action:statement:root-trigger.chap4FerdClue2-2
Garv:She likes to get into the vents here and crawl around.  Quite dirty.
Garv:Last night, she came from the vent in my room.  It's connected to an empty room, and Gwen's room.
Garv:When I tried to grab the bracelet from her, she ran out my door.  I couldn't tell you where she went after that.
Garv:She's very skilled at sneaking into different places...
next:root-chap4Bracelet
action end

action:statement:root-trigger.chap4FerdClue2-3
Garv:...I...I don't recall there being any blood on it.
Garv:I'm not sure why there would be any.
Garv:What's going on?
next:root-chap4Bracelet
action end

action:statement:root-trigger.chap4FerdClue2-4
Garv:Really?  Well then I guess I know where she went.
Garv:She seemed to hang out around the empty room next to his a lot, so that would make sense.
Garv:Say...if you saw the bracelet in Paulo's room, how did you know my cat had it last night?
next:root-connection
action end

action:response:root-connection
Quella
root-connection-A:Why would she take the bracelet all the way over there?
root-connection-B:The bracelet belonged to Marcurio.  He said your cat attacked him and took it.
action end

action:statement:root-connection-A
Garv:Who knows?
Garv:You could also ask why she would pick it up in the first place, and the answer would be the same.
Garv:Maybe she grew warm to the boy Paulo that was in that room.
next:root-connection
action end

action:statement:root-connection-B
Garv:Is that so?  How strange.
Garv:Sunshine isn't the most personable cat in the world, but she wouldn't actually attack anybody.
Garv:Not unless she was...provoked.
Garv:It sounds to me like Marcurio isn't telling the entire truth.
next:root-connection-2
action end

action:response:root-connection-2
Quella
root-connection-C:You think he provoked your cat?  Why would he do that?
<!>root-connection-D:The bracelet is really incriminating.  Why would he cover things up now?:trigger.chap6FerdClue2.on
action end

action:statement:root-connection-C
Garv:Good question.  And I think I may have some idea.
Garv:Marcurio's wrist would be way over Sunshine's head.  He is after all a full-grown human, and she is not.
Garv:Leaping that height and grabbing directly at his wrist beggars belief.  She's a good jumper, but still...
Garv:What if, instead, the bracelet was already in reach, because his hand was in front of her face?
Garv:In that case, he was either kneeling down or she was on top of a table or dresser.  Maybe...she was in the way.
next:root-connection-2
action end

action:statement:root-connection-D
Garv:Because the full truth makes things even worse for him.
Garv:I don't honestly know what would be able to force the rest out of him.
Garv:Hmm....
Garv:The vent that Sunshine came from also leads to Gwen's room.  Does she play any role in this?
