action:statement:root2-trigger.lookingforxu
Paulo:It's key that you learn more about the people on this boat.
Paulo:Doing so might seem like a diversion, but I doubt you'll be able to get to the truth in the state you are now.
Paulo:You'll need to take control of people to figure out what happened to you, and that means understanding them.

Paulo:Didn't he walk upstairs from here?  Maybe you can take control of him.
Paulo:I think he was looking for a girl named Sue...
next:root2

action:statement:root2-trigger.xuIsFollowing
Paulo:Those two are searching for a thief, huh?
Paulo:I say go along with it.  This gives you a good opportunity to meet everyone on the ship.
Paulo:Maybe their little mystery seems irrelevant to yours...but I think this may just be the tip of the iceberg.

</>root2:Okay.

action:statement:root2-xuFollowHint-2
Paulo:Well, Sue said to talk to everyone on the ship, right?
Paulo:Several of them should be on the upper floors of the ship.  I guess I'd start there.
Paulo:There might be some more people on this lower floor too.  Though they tend to stay inside their rooms...
next:root2
action end


action:statement:root2-trigger.gwenStillUnlocked
Paulo:You'll need to change the direction of the ship.  Only a couple people would be able to do that.
Paulo:How exactly you get control of them, I'm not sure.
Paulo:For now, it might be better to just focus on expanding the group of people you can possess.
Paulo:Some people will only open up to the right question, or the right person.

<?>root2-gwenHint-2:Tell me more...
</>root2:Okay.
action end

action:statement:root2-gwenHint-2
Paulo:Well, there's only one person you can control at the moment...Sue.  That kind of narrows it down a lot.
Paulo:You know, she seems to be fixated on material things.
Paulo:I wonder how she would respond to that starving artist on the bottom floor.
next:root2
action end



action:statement:root2-trigger.gwenToFerdinand
Paulo:Did you hear that announcement on the intercom?
Paulo:Kind of strange, wasn't it?  He was very vague.
Paulo:But that red-haired lady seemed to have a strong reaction to it.

</>root2:Okay.

action:statement:root2-gwenFerdHint-2
Paulo:Gwen's ears really perked up when Ferdinand spoke over the intercom.
Paulo:A conversation between the two of them could be interesting.
Paulo:First you have to be able to control Gwen, though.  That might require someone with a gentle touch...
next:root2
action end



action:statement:root2-trigger.gwenMasterKey
Paulo:That lady, Gwen, seems really interested in Donovan.
Paulo:I have to say I share her curiosity.  There's something strange going on with him.
Paulo:But...she seems too cautious to really engage with him much.  And no one else seems to be any more promising.
Paulo:If you take full control of someone, you may be able to speak directly to him.
Paulo:I wonder what would happen then.

<?>root2-gwenKeyHint-2:Tell me more...
</>root2:Okay.
action end

action:statement:root2-gwenKeyHint-2
Paulo:Alton seems like a good candidate for full possession.  He's...well, not the strongest willed person.
Paulo:There's clearly conflict between him and Sue.  That might be the key to unlocking him.
Paulo:To get him to gush about all of his emotions though, you'll need a good listener.
Paulo:If you can get him to talk to Sue, and then have Quella pick up the pieces, that should do it.
Paulo:Then if you can fully control him and find a way to talk to Donovan...well, who knows.
next:root2
action end


action:statement:root2-trigger.chap2catTime
Paulo:You certainly got Donovan's attention.  Looks like he's interested in the captain for some reason.
Paulo:Now would be a good chance to take a look around his room...but you'll still need a way to let Gwen in.
Paulo:If you could unlock his door from the other side, that should work...
Paulo:Well, I'm sure you can figure something out.

???
<?>root2-catHint-2:Tell me more...
</>root2:Okay.
action end

action:statement:root2-catHint-2
Paulo:The black cat that keeps coming in here to visit me...it's very intelligent.
Paulo:It seems to get around all parts of the ship by itself.
Paulo:It can hop up on things, climb through vents...I've even seen it open doors, somehow.
Paulo:I doubt Gwen could get into Donovan's room by herself.
Paulo:But maybe the cat can help by opening the door from the other side.
next:root2
action end


action:statement:root2-trigger.ferdinandUnlocked
Paulo:Like I said earlier, the ship is moving away from your body, and that's making things very difficult.
Paulo:If you could change the direction of the ship, your connection to this world won't be threatened.

<?>root2-ferdinandHint-2:Tell me more...
</>root2:Okay.
action end

action:statement:root2-ferdinandHint-2
Paulo:You can take control of the first mate now, right?
Paulo:He should be able to use the steering wheel to turn the ship around.
Paulo:Changing course randomly like that might seem like a bad idea, but your very existence is at stake here.
Paulo:I'm sure the ship's navigation will sort itself out.  Just focus on the task in front of you.
next:root2
action end


action:statement:root2-trigger.chap3StartHint
Paulo:Well, if there was previously any doubt who you are...there probably isn't, now.
Paulo:Who would want to murder the captain of the ship?
Paulo:Darryl seemed to take the news more personally than others.  I wonder why that is.
Paulo:...This may seem out of the blue, but I feel like that box in Xu's room might be important here.

???
<?>root2-chap3startHint-2:Tell me more...
</>root2:Okay.
action end

action:statement:root2-chap3startHint-2
Paulo:Based off of what I've seen so far, there's no way Darryl will voluntarily open up about himself.
Paulo:So you might have to get a bit underhanded.
Paulo:I've heard murmurs that a key of Darryl's went missing.  Did he lose it...or was it picked from him?
Paulo:Quella seems to be as interested in Darryl as I am.
Paulo:If she could get her hands on that key, she might be able to put it to good use.
next:root2
action end


action:statement:root2-trigger.chap3DarrylHint
Paulo:I get it...it seems you remind Darryl of some bad memories.
Paulo:He's trying to distance himself from those memories...and as a result, from what's going on around him.
Paulo:Also, can you believe that girl would steal even from passengers?  If she was found out, she could lose her job, don't you think?

Paulo:Darryl, though...he might have something more to say to her about that.
next:root2
action end


action:statement:root2-trigger.chap3XuHint
Paulo:Hmm...looks like you're running out of leads.
Paulo:Let's go back to the very beginning.
Paulo:The same night you were murdered, something was stolen from Sue's room.
Paulo:Have you wondered what it was?  It's very important.
Paulo:Well, there's only two people that know for sure.  Sue...and whoever broke into her room.

<?>root2-chap3xuHint-2:Tell me more...
</>root2:Okay.
action end

action:statement:root2-chap3xuHint-2
Paulo:Sue thinks that Donovan broke into her room, right?
Paulo:But Donovan has some dirt on her, too, so they're at an impasse.
Paulo:Let's say one of them is fully possessed by the captain's ghost - that might make one of them blink.
next:root2
action end


action:statement:root2-trigger.chap3DonovanHint
Paulo:Donovan really dropped a bomb there.  I didn't see that coming...and I'm psychic.
Paulo:With control of Donovan and that key, you can open any door on this ship.
Paulo:He thinks there's a hidden area to this ship, and he might not be wrong.  There must be clues for where you could find it.
Paulo:Still...that bad feeling is here.  Even stronger than before.
Paulo:Donovan's not telling the whole truth.  And I don't think he sees the full picture.

<?>root2-chap3donovanHint-2:Tell me more...
</>root2:Okay.
action end

action:statement:root2-chap3donovanHint-2
Paulo:What Donovan's looking for is something that shouldn't be here.  Something hidden in plain sight.
Paulo:The clues are there, pointing in its direction...but it cannot be seen with the regular eye.
Paulo:But Donovan is a meticulous person.  Obsessive, even.
Paulo:As a true detective, he has the ability to pick up on any objects that could reveal special information.
Paulo:...I wish I could be of more help.  But I feel like I'm reaching my limit.
Paulo:This is something you'll have to do on  your own.

Paulo:I don't know where you are, but it feels like I'm there too.  It's a terrible place.
Paulo:There's someone standing behind you, dressed in a black cloak.
Paulo:But they split apart into two different people, and begin to fight with each other.
Paulo:I can't make out the face of either person.  They keep changing, over and over.

Paulo:Hopefully, this could give you clues about who they are and what they'll open up to.
