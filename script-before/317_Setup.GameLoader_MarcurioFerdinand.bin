Marcurio
root-2-B:You're so damn happy all the time.
root-2-C:You talk like an idiot.
root-2-D:Nobody actually wants to work here.  Except you.
</>root-null:Ugh, forget it.
action end

action:statement:root-2-B
Ferdinand:Why, wouldn't you say that's a good thing?
Ferdinand:Being happy isn't always easy in our troubled world, but it beats the alternative!
Ferdinand:Wouldn't you say?
next:root-2-A
action end

action:statement:root-2-C
Ferdinand:Well, now you're just being mean.
next:root-2-A
action end

action:statement:root-2-D
Ferdinand:Yes, except me.
Ferdinand:I will be frank with you, Marcurio.  We are not on the most glorious ship that has touched water.
Ferdinand:Nor are our occupations the most esteemed.
Ferdinand:But it is life's highest challenge to turn less-ideal circumstances to our advantage, no?
next:root-2-A
action end

action:statement:root-3
Ferdinand:Why, as the first mate it is my job to be aware of the ship's various on goings!

Marcurio
root-3-B:Our previous first mate didn't seem so interested in the whole ship.
root-3-C:What is there going on near the passenger's rooms?  Or in the kitchen?
root-3-D:There's no other reason?  Really?
</>root-null:Never mind.
action end

action:statement:root-3-B
Ferdinand:Well, everyone has their own manner of doing things I suppose.
Ferdinand:I, for one, prefer doing my job rather than neglecting it!
next:root-3-A
action end

action:statement:root-3-C
Ferdinand:You're not thinking of the bigger picture, Marcurio!
Ferdinand:To effectively manage anything, you must understand it from top to bottom.
Ferdinand:The ship may appear to be only so many cogs and wheels.  But at its heart, it is composed of people.
Ferdinand:I would be doing the ship an injustice if I did not study the most important thing - its inhabitants!
next:root-3-A
action end

action:statement:root-3-D
Ferdinand:You wound me, Marcurio!  I don't know what I've done to earn this distrust.
Ferdinand:I do not know what strange suspicion you have of me, but hear this - Ferdinand is a man of his word, if nothing else!
