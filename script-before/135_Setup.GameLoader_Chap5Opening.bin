Garv:So now that we're out here, would you mind telling us what we're doing?

Ferdinand:Most certainly!  And I do apologize for the interruption.
Ferdinand:Generally speaking, our cruises do not involve so many meetings.
Ferdinand:I have learned recently that the secret to the ship which Donovan was looking for...exists.
Ferdinand:And more importantly, we know where it is.  We simply don't know, well, what it is.
Ferdinand:But we're going to find out now.  All of us, together, so there's no funny business!

action:statement:root3
Garv:I get it.  If we're all together, we're all safe from each other.
Quella:So...what are we expecting to find?
Xu:Well...Donovan thought the captain was being kept in a secret area on the ship.
Xu:I guess he was right about there being a hidden area on the ship.  The rest...I'm not so sure.
Marcurio:Basically what Sue means is, we have no idea what we're going to find.
Darryl:...I don't like it.
Marcurio:Don't like what?
Darryl:This plan.  Something seems off about it.
Marcurio:Well, shame you feel that way.  Ferd, what say we get a move on?
Ferdinand:...Yes!  Yes, of course.

Ferdinand:I believe it should be right around...here!
Quella:Oh my god...is that a door?
Garv:It looks like it was painted right over.  Someone put effort into keeping that hidden.
Ferdinand:Well, hidden no more it is!  Now, the door happens to have a lock...
Ferdinand:But it just so happens there is one key that can open it.  A master key!  Which we have!
Ferdinand:...Open...........sesame!!!
Marcurio:Well, how about that.  There really is a secret compartment to this bucket.
Xu:Looks like it drops down.  There's a ladder, kind of.
Ferdinand:Come on, gang.  Let's forge ahead into the unknown!

Marcurio:Jesus, this place is huge.  How is there enough space for all of this?
Darryl:It's so dark, can anyone else see anything?
Xu:Is that...blood on the ground?

Alton:What...what is that?
Quella:Oh my god...
null:........
Ferdinand:...People.  There are people down here.

action end

action:statement:root6
Quella:I think they're alive...but they aren't responsive.
Quella:Why are they even here?  What's going on?
Alton:Guys, I don't feel so good...
Marcurio:Not to interrupt, but you all might want to check this out.

action:statement:root7
Ferdinand:Hold on.  I know who that is.  That's...that's the passenger that went missing along with Donovan!
Xu:What?!  What is he doing here?  But...I don't see Donovan or the captain.
Xu:He looks really injured.  Is he...?
next:root7-null

action:statement:root8
???:Alive?
???:Yes, he's alive.  But he's seen better days.

action:statement:root9
Garv:Who said that?
Darryl:The lighting here is so poor, it's hard to see.  But it came from that direction.
Alton:That voice sounded familiar.

action:statement:root10
Donovan:I didn't expect all of you to come down here at once...
Donovan:But maybe it's better this way.
Xu:Donovan, what happened to you?!  We were sure you were dead!
Donovan:I'm not so easy to get rid of.
Donovan:There's still something I need to do before I die.
Marcurio:Have you been here the whole time?  What were you doing down here?
Donovan:Waiting.  Just...waiting...
next:root10-null
action end

action:statement:root11
Quella:Donovan, what is all of this?  Who are all these people?  What about Paulo?
Alton:And the captain.  You didn't find her, did you?  I thought, since you're here...maybe she...
Marcurio:Why didn't you show up earlier?  Why wait until now to show up?  What the hell's your plan with that?
next:root11-null
action end

action:statement:root12
Donovan:I don't have any answers.
Donovan:I don't care anymore.
Donovan:But that's okay...because there's still a solution.
Donovan:One last resort...
Donovan:Yes...this was what I came here to do...
next:root12-null
action end

action:statement:root13
Darryl:What are you doing...?
Donovan:I have a profile.  He's in this room, I know it.
Donovan:Whoever you are, you're going to die here.  There's no hiding.
Donovan:I'm going to put you down like a dog.
Donovan:...I'll give you all one chance.  One chance to prove who it is.
Donovan:But if no one knows who's responsible...there's only one thing for me to do.
Donovan:So talk.
