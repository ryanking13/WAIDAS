Xu:I guess that depends on the police.
Alton:Well, yeah.  What I meant was...what are we going to do?
Xu:Oh.  Right.  I've been thinking about that...
Xu:I don't think I can stay here.
Alton:Me too.  Not after everything I've seen on that ship.
Xu:No, I don't mean the ship.  I mean the country.
Xu:I think it's time I stopped running.  I need to face my mistakes.
Xu:I need to go home.
Xu:It scares me, but maybe that's why I need to do it.
Xu:What about you?
Alton:I...I think that's what I've been doing, too.
Alton:...Running from my mistakes.  Hiding from what really scares me.
Alton:I know what I want to do, now.  Even if I fail at it...it's worth trying.
Xu:Well, good luck.
Alton:You too.
Alton:Hey.  I know we've had our differences, but I'll really miss you.
Xu:...
Xu:You know, I really hated this ship.  I hated every second of my time on it.  And honesly, I hated you, too.
Xu:But now that I think of leaving, it's...
Xu:It's...I...I...
Xu:For once, I don't know how to say it in English.
Xu:But I feel like...I miss you already, Alton.

Xu:I'm going to go back home.  Back to China.
Alton:Oh.  That's...that's really far away, isn't it?
Xu:Yeah.  Very far.
Alton:I guess that means I won't see you again.  This is it.
Xu:Pretty much.  I mean...this was always going to happen.
Xu:I never really planned to stay here forever.
Alton:Right.  Yeah, of course.  I guess I kinda knew that.
Alton:Well...good luck, Sue.
Xu:You too, Alton.
Xu:Oh, and I never corrected you, but I might as well now.  It's "Xu".

Xu:I'm going to go back home.  Back to China.
Alton:That makes sense.  I'm going to head back home too.
Alton:This whole cruise ship thing was such a terrible idea.
Alton:I should probably get into tech and get a real job.  What are you going to do back home - wait tables?
Xu:I'll have to figure that out.  At least I'll be able to have a decent social life again.
Alton:Great.  Well, have a good life.  Or something.

Marcurio:You figured out what that bastard was up to.  Ferdinand.
Marcurio:As much as I tried to keep my ear to the pavement, I had no idea about him.
Gwen:I don't know about that.  The only reason I knew anything was because he used me.
Gwen:He knew I could be manipulated, and he used my fear against me.  Against everyone.
Marcurio:Maybe.  But you stood up to your fear, even when everyone was against you.
Marcurio:And part of you was able to see the truth, right?
Marcurio:...Look.  I'm a rotten person.  I've had some really messed up priorities, and done some stupid things.
Marcurio:If you can inspire a screw-up like me to do something right, you're on to something.

Marcurio:I never used it, but maybe you can.

Gwen:That I forgive you?  That you can change your ways?

Gwen:You don't really care.
Ferdinand:Huh?
Gwen:Your face makes all the right expressions, but there's no emotion there.  It's a mask.
Gwen:You act simple...but the truth is you know exactly what you're doing, don't you?
Gwen:You're just like him...and for the same reason you could see through me, I can see through you.

Garv:Now?  Nothing has changed for me.  Now I go back to normal life.
Garv:Keep the business going.  Buy low, sell high, that kind of thing.
Marcurio:I thought it might be hard for you to jump back into it.  With everything that's happened.
Garv:...No.  I'm a professional, after all.  I'll work something out.  I always do.
Garv:I understand all of this leaves you unemployed.  If you'd like, there might be an open position where I work.
Marcurio:That's very generous of you.
Marcurio:But I'll take my chances getting another job cooking.

Garv:Well, let's just say it's a bit more than turnips.  There's serious money in it.  Want in?
Marcurio:...You know, after everything that's happened, I don't know what I want anymore.
