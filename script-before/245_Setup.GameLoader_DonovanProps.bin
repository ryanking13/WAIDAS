Donovan:The day before last...that was the day the captain was last seen.
Donovan:There aren't any peculiar movements that morning or afternoon.
Donovan:That night, after a break the captain left her room and went up to the first floor.
Donovan:She never came back down.
Donovan:Unfortunately I couldn't install cameras on the first floor, so I don't have any eyes on her after that point.
Donovan:Between the time when she left and the next morning, every single person went up to the first floor and came back down.
Donovan:So really, anything could have happened in that time period.
Donovan:The last thing to note is when Sue came back to her room that night, she had the spare master key with her.
Donovan:She must have picked it from the pilothouse when the captain was no longer there...

Donovan:A couple things happened yesterday.
Donovan:Alton and Sue were walking all around the place talking to people.  Very strange.
Donovan:Quella was also particularly busy, walking all around talking to people.

Donovan:Today isn't over yet, but there's still plenty of footage to cover.
Donovan:At the crack of dawn, Ferdinand paid a visit to Garv's room.  Odd.

Donovan:This is the lowest floor, where all passengers stay.
Donovan:As expected, there's a lot of people moving in and out of their rooms from day to day.
Donovan:The only constant is that black cat, which wanders around everywhere.
Donovan:Sometimes it's carrying small objects in its mouth...it's a small-time thief, I guess.
Donovan:There really isn't anything suspicious that goes on down here from day to day, though.

action:statement:root-cameraB2
Donovan:This is the middle floor, where all the staff stay.
Donovan:Usually people are walking through here to reach the upper deck, where I don't have any cameras.
Donovan:Marcurio and Garv are always going in and out of the broom closet for cleaning supplies.
Donovan:Almost every day since we've disembarked, in fact.
Donovan:Ferdinand is always walking around everywhere with that stupid grin on his face.
Donovan:Darryl walks through here once or twice a day, but spends all day on the upper deck.

null:I'd throw away my badge and go after him myself, but I got close to him.  My identity was compromised.
null:I need someone from outside that he doesn't know.  You're the only one who can do this, Donovan.
null:It's been a long time since he's struck, and it's possible he'll regard this isolated ship as a prime opportunity.

null:I'm breaking a lot of regulations, and personal standards, enlisting your help like this.  I'm putting a lot of trust in you.
